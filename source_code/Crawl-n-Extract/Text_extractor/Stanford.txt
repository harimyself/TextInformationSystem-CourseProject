support of Black Lives Matter Dear CS Community In support of the Black Lives Matter movement we recommit to eradicating racism wherever it is found including in ourselves and our institutions We are outraged by the brutal murders of George Floyd Ahmaud Arbery Breonna Taylor Tony McDade Nina Pop David McAtee and countless other black Americans who have lost their lives as a consequence of police brutality and racism Words can t adequately convey the emotions of the moment Anger Frustration Despair The challenge that we face reminds us that the last few months and last few weeks have impacted all of us in this department in some way and some of us profoundly Know that there are teachers staff and students who stand with you As a department we strive to uphold the Fundamental Standard of respect and dignity for all members of the Stanford community Today we ask you to join us in exploring the ways in which our field computer science reinforces systemic injustice We commit ourselves and our department to questioning the comfortable status quo and closing the digital divide to seek equality and face injustice ShutDownSTEM Day June 10 Tomorrow is ShutDownSTEM day We invite and support all faculty staff and students in our department to set aside some of our regular tasks and take time for education action and healing including reflecting on how this statement applies to us Academia and STEM are global endeavors that sustain a racist system where Black people are murdered No matter where you physically live you impact and are impacted by this moment in history This is not exclusive to the United States We must all work against anti Black racism ShutDownSTEM About https www shutdownstem com about We acknowledge that students may have remaining academic obligations those who cannot set aside time tomorrow for any reason are asked to devote time and attention this week and on a continuing basis Our Department Community The Stanford CS department lacks diversity and must work to support Black excellence We recognize that Black and other marginalized people including Indigenous Latinx and Hispanic and first generation low income scholars are underrepresented among our faculty staff graduate students and undergraduate majors The University School of Engineering and our department have ongoing efforts to redress this but we have to do more We acknowledge a long duration of wrongs from the founding of Stanford University on ancestral Ohlone lands to anti Black housing discrimination that creates a persistent wealth and educational access gap between Palo Alto and neighboring cities and even to the present when our response to the murders and protests was slower and less emphatic than it ought to have been Computer Science Technology and Racism Modern digital technology the product of academic research and entrepreneurial leaders in this department and others like it is now a pervasive force in the world today Even without coronavirus a massive portion of human interaction is mediated by digital technology and social media all the more so during the current pandemic affecting us all Algorithms data collection networking information services replacing thoughtful journalism automatic decision making at a huge scale based on sensitive personal data and more shape modern thought identity and action in subtle extensive and often corrosive ways The impact extends far beyond what any of its creators could imagine Yet as those responsible for its continued design creation and development we bear responsibility for reckoning with the consequences of modern digital technology in furthering privilege racism inequity policing and oppression We acknowledge the work of scholars many of whom are black women who have been studying and warning about these issues for many years Departmental Action to Support Black Members of Our Community We will be taking additional measures to put these commitments into action These include A commitment to honest and active communication Inclusive graduate admissions student recruitment mentoring and support of black and marginalized people Improved recruitment and hiring processes at all levels drawing on current research and best practices to prevent bias Commitment to continued support for campus and departmental organizations such as Black in CS and SBSE that serve essential functions including funding student participation in workshops and conferences Courses applying the tools of academic inquiry to understanding the role our field too often plays in furthering privilege racism inequity policing and oppression Academic commitment to the continuous advancement of responsible computing and to addressing different forms of harm due to computing technologies Heightened scrutiny of academic industry relationships with corporations whose work furthers or profits from racism inequity policing and oppression Commitment to the continued support of outreach and education programs for young scientists particularly those from underrepresented communities A departmental Town Hall to listen to and support community members and assemble the basis for further action We ask you to share your ideas and feedback on how to move toward greater justice We cannot do it alone we can only do it together Feel free to send your ideas and feedback to the CS Diversity Committee Chair Moses Charikar moses cs stanford edu or leave anonymous feedback https forms gle kWX3FWRXDd5ULkJJ9 Speaking personally we want to be sure that all members of our community hear these

recollection is from Vaughan Pratt The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake brought planning for a new building to an abrupt halt quite literally It occurred during a late Tuesday afternoon building planning session in Margaret Jacks in the meeting room adjacent to room146 At around 4 55 pm I asked why the proposed building couldn t copy the pleasing fractal shapes of the main quad more closely One of the planners said that those shapes were too susceptible to earthquake damage At 5 04 pm the quake struck illustrating his point by doing considerably more damage to the quad than to the other buildings around campus Actually the meeting was just upstairs from 146 We saw the foyer chandelier swinging as we headed downstairs to leave the building 1990 Jeff Ullman becomes chair Eric Roberts and Marc

and caring colleague Hector Garcia Molina a professor of computer science and of electrical engineering who pioneered some of the database technologies that underlie modern cloud computing died of cancer on Nov 25 on the eve of his 66th birthday He will be sorely missed said Stanford Provost Persis Drell who became acquainted with Garcia Molina while she served as dean of Stanford s School of Engineering Jennifer Widom who is currently dean of the school and had long standing research collaborations with Garcia Molina received an outpouring of messages extolling the humility and wisdom that made him a sought after mentor His door was always open and he welcomed everyone with a smile Widom said Hector served as a mentor to me from the time I arrived as an assistant professor through

emeritus at Stanford whose research helped pave the way for electronics and computing died on Feb 13 He was 86 Born on the eve of the Great Depression McCluskey graduated from Bowdoin College in Maine in 1953 earning honors in mathematics and physics then went on to study electrical engineering at MIT where he earned his doctorate in 1956 But the experience that set him on the path toward professional greatness occurred during the period from 1955 through 1959 when he worked first as an MIT intern and later as a staff researcher at Bell Telephone Laboratories during its heyday In a 2008 lecture when he won an award from the Association for Computing Machinery ACM McCluskey fondly recalled that storied period when Bell researchers were inventing many of the building blocks of electronics and computing It was in this intellectual crucible that McCluskey helped devise a way to efficiently and unerringly design logic chips read more Professor John McCarthy October 2011 The Department of Computer Science is saddened to report that Emeritus Professor John McCarthy died on October 24 2011 at age 84 John was one of the founders of artificial intelligence AI coining that name in 1955 From that time until his death he made foundational contributions both to AI and to computer science in general In a famous 1958 paper and subsequent memos he proposed and thereafter strongly held that the knowledge needed by AI programs should be represented in declarative sentences principally in a logical language rather than being encoded within the programs that use that knowledge As he put it Sentences can be true in much wider contexts than specific programs can be useful John s work on AI systems that could reason with declarative knowledge inspired a legion of researchers who along with John advanced this approach to AI and produced many practical applications of it Realizing some of the difficulties of getting logical systems to read more Professor Rajeev Motwani June 2009 Rajeev Motwani Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University passed away on June 5 2009 Rajeev was a luminary in many academic disciplines He made fundamental contributions to the foundations of computer science search and information retrieval streaming databases and data mining and robotics In these areas he considered questions as philosophical as what makes problems inherently intractable and as practical as finding similar images and documents from a database His text book Randomized Algorithms with Prabhakar Raghavan epitomizes this meeting of the abstract and the concrete and has been a source of inspiration to countless students He has received many awards for his research notably the G del Prize and the Arthur P Sloan Foundation Research Fellowship Rajeev s academic legacy extends to teaching and advising a large number of students many of whom have gone on to successful academic careers In addition to his academic read more Professor Gene H

Sept 25 after a long illness He was 65 In the old days programmers would just twiddle with programs till they seemed to work says Professor Emeritus of The Art of Computer Programming Donald Knuth Floyd showed that there was a way to prove programs would work His approach of marrying math with computer science was a revelation to the field Knuth says Floyd s 1960s method of invariants in which assertions are attached to points in a computer program is still the basis of much work in proving that computer programs meet their specifications says John McCarthy professor emeritus of computer science Born in New York on June 8 1936 Floyd was recognized as a child prodigy at age 6 he skipped three grades and finished high school at 14 A scholarship allowed him to study at the University of

this year Example I started my MS in Fall 2019 can I use the program sheet of 2020 21 instead of 2019 20 A The answer is Yes You may use any program sheet made available between the time you enrolled in the program and the time you graduate Q What courses can I count as Electives on my program sheet A Courses numbered above 111 in the Computer Science department except CS196 198 and 390A B C can be counted as electives In general non CS courses in the School of Engineering Mathematics or Statistics departments that are numbered above 100 and are of a technical nature are acceptable technical meaning that the course involves programming use of college level mathematics statistics or engineering concepts Other courses for example those in entrepeneurship ethics art history languages athletics and public speaking cannot be counted as elective course work Unit Requirements Q What is the minimum number of units I can take per quarter Is it the same for my last quarter before graduation A Every student has to register for at least 8 units per quarter The only exceptions are summer quarter when the minimum is one unit and the last quarter before graduation when students may by filling a Request for Graduate Part Time Enrollment take as few as 3 units Q What is the minimum number of units required for the degree A You have to complete 45 units and no transfer units are allowed Curricular Practical Training CPT Q How can I do a curricular practical training A Information can be found at the Bechtel International Center web site https bechtel stanford edu immigration employment f 1 employment curri Q What is the minimum number of units I have to register for if I do CPT during the summer quarter A Students may choose to enroll in as little as 1 unit during the summer CPT is a one unit course and may be the only course on the summer quarter study list Students can enroll in CS390A once CS390B once and CS390C once Assistantships Q How can I get a TA position When should I apply A Please look for emails sent to MS students by Danielle Hoversten These emails are sent every quarter and specify the procedure to follow to apply for a TA Q How can I get an RA A Research Assistantships are usually offered by professors for specific projects The best way to get an RA is to browse the research projects within the department If you are interested in a specific project you may contact one of the professors from the corresponding research group and explain your interests and ideas to him her Another way is to expose your own project ideas to professors in the field Q Am I still a full time student if I have a TA or RA appointment A Yes and you still have to take at least 8 units of courses per quarter see previous section for unit requirement Coterm FAQ up

Research Cluster Policy Server Hosting University Policies Xenon Student Account Policies Research ClustersSAIL Compute Cluster Services The Team Coterm FAQ How does enrollment work for coterm students Starting with your first Coterm Quarter you will have two careers on Axess an undergraduate career and a graduate career When you enroll in a course you can either place it in your undergraduate career or graduate career You can decide whether you want to enroll in undergrad courses grad courses or both What if I don t want to take graduate classes right away As a coterm student you choose which classes to take each quarter You can take undergrad courses graduate courses or both If I already took a course as an undergrad can I use it towards my graduate requirements instead Any course that you took sophomore year or later can be used towards your MSCS requirements Any course that you took frosh year cannot be used towards your MSCS requirements Keep in mind Every course that you want to list on your BSCS Program Sheet must be in your undergraduate career on Axess Every course that you want to list on our MSCS Program Sheet must be in your graduate career on Axess To move a course that you already took to another career use the Coterm Course Transfer form which can be found in Axess Why do I get an error when I try to drop a course in Axess Axess might give you an error if you try to drop to 0 units in either of your careers When this happens you ll need to submit a form to drop the class Submit the Multiple Career Enrollment Form to the Student Services Center This can be found on Axess under the Student eForms link How does tuition work Coterms fall into one of two categories when it comes to tuition coterm undergrads and coterm grads This is also referred to as your Billing Group Undergraduate Billing Group and Graduate Billing Group This status only applies to how you are charged tuition It has nothing to do with whether you ve completed your bachelor degree or which classes you re taking Coterms have undergrad status through the end of your 12th quarter meaning you re charged undergraduate tuition for your first 12 quarters Starting with your 13th quarter coterms reach coterm grad status and are charged graduate tuition Again this has nothing to do with what classes you re taking or whether you ve conferred your bachelors degree In either case you re welcome to take undergrad courses graduate courses or both The university looks at the total number of units that you re taking and charges you tuition according to your status The tuition rates can be found here https registrar stanford edu students tuition You ll want to look at the Graduate Engineering rates Can I move to coterm grad status early before my 5th year Yes You can move to coterm grad status early if you a confer your bachelors degree or b request to move to coterm grad status early In either case you need to have completed at least 180 undergrad units Why would I want to move to coterm grad status early If you want to be hired as a Research Assistant or Course Assistant We can only hire graduate students as CAs RAs and this means that you ll need coterm grad status What else do I need to know about moving to coterm grad status early Once you move to grad status you cannot move back to undergrad status Moving to grad status might affect your undergraduate financial aid package Talk to the Financial Aid office to see how your aid package might be affected You are still covered by the university s guaranteed housing through the end of your fourth year Who is my MSCS Advisor Coterm students who have a CS faculty advisor for their BS will continue with that same advisor through completion of their CS MS degree program If you would like a new advisor first get permission from the new advisor and then send an email to Meredith Hutchin asking to change your MS advisor When should I turn in a Program Sheet You should submit a MSCS Program Sheet by the end of your first quarter in the coterm program In order to submit a Program Sheet log in to gin stanford edu with your CS ID and password and click on the Dashboard link If you took a course as an undergrad that is required on the Program Sheet you can satisfy the MSCS requirement but apply 0 units towards your MS degree You cannot double count units towards both your bachelors and masters degree The MSCS Program must include at least 45 unique units If you ve taken courses in previous quarters that you re not using for your undergraduate degree and that you now want to count towards your CS MS you ll need to submit a Coterminal Course Transfer Form to move them to your graduate career You can move a course from your undergraduate to your graduate career as long as you took the course during your sophomore year or later Be sure to file this form before your BA or BS is conferred once your BA or BS has been conferred you can no longer move any courses The Coterminal Course Transfer Form can be found on Axess under the Student eForms link How does a Leave of Absence work As a coterm student you ll need to take a LOA from both your bachelors and masters programs The CS Department will let you take a LOA for any reason You can take a maximum 1 year LOA from the CS masters program What if I want to take a Leave of Absence for two years The CS Department will allow a maximum one year LOA After this year expires your MSCS program is discontinued Once your program has been discontinued you ll need to Apply for Reinstatement to return to the MSCS program Applying for Reinstatement involves paying a fee and filling out a form The CS department is not obligated to accept you back into the program But really as long as you left Stanford in good academic standing we want to see you come back When should I graduate Coterm students are required to have one Overlap Quarter during which both your bachelor and masters programs are open After your overlap quarter you are free to confer your bachelors degree ie graduate and continue to take graduate coursework or you can wait and confer your BS and MS degrees at the same time There are two things you can t do you can t graduate before your overlap quarter and you can t graduate with your MS before you graduate with your BS degree Please see the university s Coterm FAQ page for more helpful information Choosing

The teaching requirement may be satisfied at any time As a matter of policy a student should satisfy half of the teaching requirement in the first two years Students are encouraged to complete the teaching requirement early in their stay to eliminate conflicts with later dissertation work The research requirement is routinely satisfied by participation in research throughout the student s career Note Any form that requires Department Chair s signature should be submitted to the PhD student services office in Gates 196 PhD Program Officer approves those forms on behalf of the department chair Candidacy University policy requires that all doctoral students declare candidacy by the end of the sixth quarter in residence excluding summers Once you have a permanent advisor and have

contract between the department and the student The department acknowledges that the student is a bona fide candidate for the Ph D and agrees that the program submitted by the student is sufficient to warrant granting the Ph D upon completion The department may not change requirements unilaterally The student may petition the department for modification of his or her program Candidacy expires five

collaborating research organization The Ph D program is full time and requires full tuition most or all of which is normally covered by such support Since Ph D students have 50 RAships or CAships full time equals 8 10 units Students with partial or no support may not register part time but must make up any tuition shortfall themselves except as noted Hertz NSF NPSC Fellows may register for 8 10 units also University Graduation TGR Requirements A student may go TGR after all the Ph D requirements have been completed and just their orals and submission of the dissertation remain see CS Ph D Program Milestone Checklist for reference Students are strongly encouraged to apply for TGR status as soon as they are eligible as the TGR fee is 40 of regular tuition The School of Engineering and the University expects students making reasonable progress to be TGR for only one year To advance to TGR status you need to fill out and submit the TGR form which is now housed in the eForms portal See https stanford app box com v tgrreq for more details Unit Based Requirements These requirements are 135 course research credit units are required to graduate with the Ph D Once you have completed the 135 units of course research credit and all program requirements up to your Orals and Dissertation then you are eligible to apply for TGR status Up to 45 units completed at Stanford or accepted as transfer credit toward a Masters degree may be used toward the 135 units of residency requirement for the doctoral degree Application for transfer of credit may be requested after at least one quarter of enrollment Additional Information on Enrollment Students who are on most fellowships register for at least 8 or 10 units Certain outside fellowships require 12 units a quarter so if you have a question concerning this contact the Ph D Program Officer Students who are on 50 research or course assistantships register for at least 8 units and should register for 10 as the tuition is the same for 8 to 10 units Students who are on 25 research or course assistantships should register for a minimum of 8 and maximum of 10 units The assistantship covers 5 units and the student must make up the difference It is recommended that Ph D students seek a 50 assistantship or two 25 assistantships Students who are on a 90 research assistantship in the summer register for 3 units of CS499 If the student is TGR then they register for 0 units of CS802 For students on 50 CAships RAships or fellowships during the summer the above rules apply TGR fees only provide for maintenance of matriculation they do not represent tuition If a TGR student wishes to take a course for credit then the student will pay tuition on a unit basis at a special tuition rate Leave of Absence Before filing for candidacy a student may not take a leave of absence unless there is an extenuating circumstance All University and departmental progress guidelines are suspended during the leave After filing for candidacy a student may take a leave if their advisor appoves it but the leave does not extend the period of candidacy Leaves will not be granted for more than one year at a time A leave of absence from your program may not exceed a cumulative total of two years Distinction in Teaching A graduating Ph D student will be awarded a certificate of Distinction in Teaching if the following conditions are met The student is nominated for this distinction by at least one CS faculty member who has supervised the student as a Course Assistant This nomination is e mailed to the Ph D Program Officer The student has completed 10 units of CA or TF ship where each unit counts as one 25 CA or TF ship i e five 50 CAships The units must include at least one course at the 100 course level and at least one course at either the 200 or 300 plus course levels The student has taught at least one course as a Teaching Fellow with primary responsibility for organizing and teaching a course tutored video does not qualify Evaluation The department will check with the advisor annually to ensure that the student is making satisfactory progress towards the completion of their degree The Computer Science PhD student services sends each Ph D student an e mail with updates on the student s milestone and research progress Individualized evaluations are sent to each student via e mail throughout the summer This evaluation is based on information available to the Ph D Program Officer at the time of the evaluation meeting Please be sure to e mail phdstudentservices cs stanford edu whenever you complete a breadth requirement or milestone throught the year in order to keep you records current As per the Honor Code it is the student s responsibility to contact the Program Officer with regard to any error or correction to their records If a student is not making reasonable progress and further action needs to be taken The student s advisor Director of Graduate Studies and the Department Chair will meet to evaluate the next step that should be taken By University Policy the student has the right and can request to meet with the Director of Graduate Studies The student can submit a request for an ombudsman Failure to schedule the meeting constitutes a waiver of the university mandated right to a hearing and can lead to dismissal without further warning Academic Requirements PhD Orientation

Year Research Rotation Program First year Ph D students can spend 1 quarter each in 3 groups They must align with a permanent advisor by the middle of Spring quarter of the first year Look over the department website and research group pages to get ideas or information about specific faculty you might be interested in working with for rotations You are encouraged to line up your own research rotations Be sure to contact the faculty directly to confirm their consent You must email the Graduate Program Office at phdstudentservices cs stanford edu about your rotations by the following dates Autumn quarter August 15 Winter quarter December 15 Spring Quarter March 15 Alternatively you can tell us your preferences for advisors or research areas and the Graduate Program Office will line up a research rotation for you Note that this requires you to be somewhat flexible in the positions that you ll accept Send your e mail to phdstudentservices cs stanford edu with your preferences for advisors or research areas by the deadlines listed above An entering Ph D student and a faculty member may opt out of the rotation system by mutual consent In this case the faculty member must agree to serve as the student s research advisor and notify the Graduate Program Office by e mailing phdstudentservices cs stanford edu Fine print If a student starts as a rotation student but then does a second quarter in the first year with the same advisor then the student has ceased to rotate and counts as permanently aligned with the advisor who fully supports them in the second and further quarters Note All faculty hosting a rotating CS 1st year PhD student pay 25 and the department pays 25 of a 50 RAship This applies to all faculty full CS joint CS and outside of CS If the student has a fellowship then the RAship is not needed For students with NSF fellowship faculty advisor supplements them to bring their amount up to the department level RAship The supplementation continues for NSF students from their faculty advisor after they align with a faculty until they finish their PhD program as long as the student makes satisfactory academic progress Due to current situation students can not recieve Research Assistatnship Course Assistantship if they are overseas and enrolling remotely due to legal and tax implications As far as funding first year students who are not on any fellowship will get the 25 RAship equivalent as fellowship this year from the department due to unusual circumstances The other 25 RAship equivalent has to be discussed with the rotation advisor for funding support If the faculty is able and willing to support you with their unrestricted gift account then you should be able to receive the 25 RA equivalent as fellowship Remember that the goal of the rotation program is to find an advisor You should make sure that by the end of the year there s at least one faculty member who is impressed with you and with whom you d like to work You should align with an advisor by the end of spring quarter of your first year If you align with a non CS faculty you should have a CS faculty courtesy faculty do not count as a coadvisor Please see the

and 2 affiliated but at least 1 core should be present 2 The student is asked to prepare a 30 minute presentation on a research project the student is working on 3 The student supplies to each commitee member a short report summarizing the student s research project and a list of references that is related to such a project Report and list of references are due to the committee members 3 days before the exam 4 The exam is one hour long and it is divided in two parts 4 a During the first half hour the student presents the research project 4 b The second half hour comprises a 30min of QA session related to the research project by the committee During such session committee members can but are not necessarily committed to ask questions related to any of the papers in the list of references This gives the opportunity to committee members to assess general mastery of the area the student is working on Computational Biology 1 The student must form a committee with 3 members The candidate s advisor s should be member s At least one member must be a Stanford CS faculty Two members must be working in Computational Biology One member will be non computational from an affected field of biomedicine At least two members must be doing work directly relevant to the candidate s work 2 The exam should take 60 90 minutes The candidate should prepare 30 minutes presentation on their research 30 minutes presentation on 3 papers which are jointly picked by the quals committee and the student relating to the student s current and future research directions 3 After the exam has been taken the candidate will email the CS PhD Student Services Admin cc ing all members of their quals committee with the exam s outcome Physiqual The Physiqual will now consist of exams with faculty in 5 areas vision geometry math graphics and robotics The second part of the Physiqual which consists of a talk on a few selected papers will no longer be part of the Physiqual given that we now have

First year Ph D students can spend 1 quarter each in 3 groups They must align with a permanent advisor by the middle of Spring quarter of the first year Look over the department website and research group pages to get ideas or information about specific faculty you might be interested in working with for rotations You are encouraged to line up your own research rotations Be sure to contact the faculty directly to confirm their consent You need to tell the Graduate Program Office about your autumn quarter rotation by August 15 Information on any rotations that you have lined up must be e mailed to phdstudentservices cs stanford edu Alternatively you can tell us your preferences for advisors or research areas and the Graduate Program Office will line up a research rotation for you Note that this requires you to be somewhat flexible in the positions that you ll accept Send your e mail to phdstudentservices cs stanford edu with your preferences for advisors or research areas by August 15 An entering Ph D student and a faculty member may opt out of the rotation system by mutual consent In this case the faculty member must agree to serve as the student s research advisor and notify the Graduate Program Office by e mailing phdstudentservices cs stanford edu Fine print If a student starts as a rotation student but then does a second quarter in the first year with the same advisor then the student has ceased to rotate and counts as permanently aligned with the advisor who fully supports them in the second and further quarters Remember that the goal of the rotation program is to find an advisor You should make sure that by the end of the year there s at least one faculty member who is impressed with you and with whom you d like to work Life in Gates Covid update no one is

an eye out in the following weeks for an email from Meredith Hutchin regarding the mandatory CA Training and other important information you will need When will my tuition waiver go into effect The exact timing varies but the tuition waiver will go into effect prior to the tuition deadline Fall Quarter Oct 15 Winter Jan 15 Spring April 15 Summer July 15 When do I get paid For the 2018 19 school year paydates are as follows Autumn Quarter Paydates October 22 November 7 November 22 December 7 December 22 January 7 Winter Quarter Paydates January 22 February 7 February 22 March 7 March 22 April 7 Spring Quarter Paydates April 22 May 7 May 22 June 7 June 22 July 7 Summer Quarter Paydates July 22 August 7 August 22 September 7 Where can I borrow textbooks for my course There is a small library of CS textbooks located in Nan Aoki s office Gates 182 which are available for borrowing by TAs Texts are to be returned at the end of the quarter Make sure to borrow the textbook for the class if you don t have it If it is not in the library contact Mindy Chang at mchang15 stanford edu to see if the department is able to purchase a copy for you Who do I contact to schedule a room reserve a space for a poster session Please contact Mindy Chang mchang15 stanford edu for assistance regarding scheduling rooms reimbursements alternative exams poster sessions and copy codes Please try and give Mindy as much advanced warning as possible Should I attend classes It is up to the instructor to decide whether you should attend the classes or not Keep in mind that if you attend classes you will be better in sync with the class and will be able to develop your own perspective on the material Additionally the time after class is perfect to meet the students and let them know that you exist When should I set office hours If the class is offered to SCPD students one CA should have an office hour sometime after 6pm so that SCPD students can come by after work Please discuss office hours with the faculty member for the course you re working Office hours can usually be scheduled flexibly but be aware that if you set an office hour the day before the homework is due around 4pm chances are that you will have a lot of students attend Another opinion Setting office hours right before due date is convenient for those who procrastinate However it also encourages procrastination There are a couple good reasons for having office hours a little in advance of due dates It doesn t reward procrastination It recognizes the fact that assignments aren t always flawless If people need to start looking at the homework well in advance of the due date in order to see what questions they might have for office hours this provides time for the CAs to correct or disambiguate the assignment and reduces everyone s stress level How do I get access to the course website In order to get access to the course website please contact the IT department here How do I get added as a CA TA on Canvas Contact the instructor if you would like to be added as a CA TA on Canvas Should I prepare assignments Solutions CA s are not typically responsible for creating assignments but you may be asked to prepare solutions if the instructor doesn t already have them It is a good idea to prepare solutions in the light of the errors you saw the most often made while grading At the end of a solution you may list typical mistakes and the reason why these are mistakes so that students learn by the mistakes made by others you will at the same time reduce the number of requests for regradings How do I make copies You should ask Mindy Chang mchang15 stanford edu for the copy code that is to be used for the class This code works on all copy machines in the Gates building For big copy jobs it is recommended to use the fastest machine Gates 169 For help with the copy machine or if you notice we re running low on paper please see Hector Gamez Gates B18 File Attachments Public CS Climate 9 26

being used to meet the requirement Top of page Q What do I put for my overall GPA and max GPA at your school on the online application form A Maximum GPA varies from school to school Most U S universities follow a 4 0 scale There are some exceptions where the scale extends to 15 points case in point Harvard University Stanford follows a 4 3 scale which distinguishes the minus and plus grades for the top three letter grades It is best to state the cumulative GPA CGPA or the UG GPA that appears at the end of the latest quarter semester grades This is an average of all your quarter semester grades A weighted average calculation is necessary when courses have variable credits units structure Note to International Students If your institution does not follow a GPA system please enter the required GPA in the Unconverted GPA field on the application If your institution follows an absolute grading system please use the maximum absolute aggregate for your institution in the Unconverted GPA System field and the aggregate score you have obtained in the Unconverted GPA field At most foreign universities it is typically out of 10 20 or 100 points The maximum score per course is defined on the transcript in almost all cases For example if the maximum score is 100 points per course and you have 6 courses per semester your unconverted scale value would be 4800 8x6x100 for the eight quarters of undergraduate program If you obtained 3700 points out of the potential 4800 points that will be your unconverted GPA Please do not normalize your GPA to reflect a value relative to the highest achieved aggregate score in your class batch year The only exceptions are Physical Education and Military History these two courses can be eliminated from the calculation Please utilize the Additional Information section under Statement of Purpose section to briefly highlight the grading system used by your institution and your relative placement in that grading scheme Top of page Q

Research Cluster Policy Server Hosting University Policies Xenon Student Account Policies Research ClustersSAIL Compute Cluster Services The Team Computing Environment Computing Environment Overview The Computer Science Department operates several large computer systems for education research and administration These systems together with many other research computers are connected to SUNet the University s network and thence to the Internet The Computer Science Department with its varied individual research groups also operates and supports hundreds of workstations Apple Intel Dell and Sun Microsystems are among the most prominent vendors of the workstations These systems are all connected by the department s network to the University backbone CS administration computing environment The CS administrative computing environment includes many virtual machines This system is used primarily for general timesharing and mail service popserver imap and provides database warehousing The department administrators use a blend of Macs and PCs The programming staffs use and or have access to all platforms SGI HP DEC IBM Sun Mac Intel that CSD CF supports The faculty computing environment differs from research group to research group Gates building network The network in the Gates Building is a switched network consisting of twenty VLANs This network is comprised of Juniper and HP switches and routers This provides the Gates Building with Gigabit networking and connection to the campus backbone CS student computing environment Networking in Offices CSD has a networked workstation for virtually every person with an office The department provides these for staff and for some first year PhD students but most workstations are provided by research groups for the use of their faculty staff and students Most workstations are running some version of Unix although many of the staff use Macs Xenon For general use by CSD students there are two main machines plus a lab with a cluster of workstations All of these machines are provided particularly for handling electronic mail and reading Usenet newsgroups Myth Cluster Located in the basement of Gates in B21 the Myths are a cluster of Intel workstations running Ubuntu Email One feature of the department is that you get a potentially permanent email address within the domain CS Stanford EDU This CS email address can forward your mail to whatever computer you are currently using to read mail Students involved with a given research project as happens with most PhD and some Masters students generally move most of their activities onto machines owned by the research group Every PhD student can pretty much expect to have a research group workstation on his or her desk Such machines generally give better response and more available disk space than can be obtained from Xenon Leland The University also provides computer access for all of its students namely with the Leland machines These includes workstations of various kinds and are intended almost exclusively for class work plus email and news They are not part of CSD nor are they maintained by CSD With an account on the Leland machines you get another email address which is valid as long as you are a Stanford student Account Information For SUNet information from the University s server click here For SUNetID information from the University s

Policy Research Cluster Policy Server Hosting University Policies Xenon Student Account Policies Research ClustersSAIL Compute Cluster Services The Team Privileged Access Policy Privileged Access i e root or root equivalents for machines managed by CSD CF are bestowed to those who need it via the sudocommand sudo is short for SUperuser DO To use it simply prefix the command you want to run as root with sudo For example sudo sbin rebootsudo will ask you to authenticate yourself by typing in your password sudo remembers your password for five minutes after the last sudo command you ran so that you don t have to continually enter your password Why we use sudo instead of giving out the root password Root is all powerful In Unix and Unix like systems system administration privileges are all or nothing A user either has root access or not and root access implies complete control of a machine If the machine in question is used by more than one person or root has access to other systems or user files it is more acceptable to give some users partial root privileges The root user can hide all of their actions sudo logs every command run via sudo Having a record of what s being done with sudo helps us diagnose problems with individual systems processes and general confiugration issues as well as helping us identify needed improvements The root password gives you access to any command on a system Via its config file sudo can give a user root access for particular set of commands This also avoids the all or nothing effect alllowing us to give individual users more control over their machines and to help themselves out of common problems Who can get sudo privileges Anyone who wants sudo privileges must first read and accept the terms set down by this policy Systems people those who have traditionally performed systems administration duties and are responsible for maintaining particular software applications or systems can have sudo privileges on some CS systems upon request Faculty can have sudo privileges on all computers that belong to them upon request Visiting faculty staff students and post docs with a legitimate need for privileged access can get sudo privileges on their personal desktops upon request All others may get sudo privileges with sufficient justification On what systems can you get sudo privileges Personal workstations Privileged access to a general purpose research workstation may be granted to specific users of that workstation with a legitimate need for privileged access Research systems Privileged access to computers designated for special purpose research may be granted to users of those computers with a legitimate need for privileged access Privileged access will not be granted to any user on the following systems File servers Mail servers or any servers holding mail for multiple users General purpose multiuser computers Servers and infrastructure computers Do s and Don ts of Privileged Access Don t change the root password on your machine Don t change the password of any users especially root The only password you are responsible for and the only password you are allowed to change is your own Changing the root or any other password will result in loss of privileged access and possible termination of your account Don t add user accounts to the system Access to computer systems in the Computer Science Department are controlled exclusively by CSD CF Don t grant sudo access to any user Being granted privileged access to a machine does not entitle you to grant the same access to others Anyone who needs such access must request it from the system administrators Granting privileged access to others will result in loss of privileged access and possible termination of your account Choose an extrordinary password for your personal account This is especially important because your password can be used to exercise certain root privileges For similar reasons we expect anyone who accepts these privileges to take extrodinary care in protecting their password Never send your password in the clear over the network change your password immediately should you do this Never email your password Never share your password with anybody Don t run network daemons i e no ircd no ftpd If you think you need to run a network service please talk with a system administrator Don t use sudo to run a shell e g sudo bash or to just become root via su We know it s a small additional burden to have to prefix each command with sudo but we the systems adminstrators would like to keep a handle on what people are doing to their systems so that chaos does not take over the department It is much easier to diagnose a problem if we know what has been done to a machine to create or attempt to address a problem Similarly it is much easier for us to understand how you cleverly solved some problem if we have a record of the actions you performed We use sudo too Log trails are an important part of enabling multiple people to manage the complexities of a large system Don t use sudo to su to another user It is a violation of Department and University policy to use the account of another user Doing so will result in the loss of your privileged access and possible termination of your account If you make changes to your system write down what you did Not for us for yourself The configuration of Linux systems in CS is constantly evolving We will have to reinstall the OS on your system from time to time although we will try to keep such reinstalls to a minimum Our official policy is that all machines should be able to be rebuilt using our automated kickstart process at any point in time CSD CF should be aware of any specific customizations made on a machine to ensure your changes needs survive OS reinstalls If you want to make a change to your system configuration please talk to the systems administrators first We may have already provided a solution to the problem you are trying to solve Also what you want may be something we should be doing CS wide Extrodinary user customization is not a valid excuse to defer or forgo an OS upgrade when it becomes available If you royally mess up your system you re on your own The only thing we will do is reinstall the OS If you mess up your system in a small way we may help you repair it at our discretion If a system is compromised by your action you will be held accountable for the results When in doubt ask the system administrators If you re not absolutely sure of what you re doing consult the system administrators Doing so is encouraged and saves everybody

Student Account Policies These policies provide guidelines for use of accounts on the student machine Xenon Failure to abide by these policies puts the user at risk of having his or her Xenon account disabled or removed These policies are subject to change without notice Passwords Easy passwords will not be allowed by the passwd program Never include your actual password in email email is not secure If you have a problem with your password go to Gates rooms 161 170 during business hours Bring your Stanford photo ID with you Xenon accounts Each student in CSD is provided with an account on Xenon Under normal circumstances if a student graduates from CSD he or she may keep his or her account for life Or until this part of the policy is changed Students who leave CSD without obtaining a degree will lose their accounts unless they are expected to return and they have been gone less than nine months Accounts may be disabled or removed if the account is being misused or seems to have been abandoned Alumni who lack an account may request a new account or reinstatement of an old account Under the current policy account names are not normally changed after the account is opened Similarly CS email aliases used for directing email through cs stanford edu are normally not changed except with the consent of the owner There are however situations where an account name or CS email alias will be changed or eliminated This is normally decided on a case by case basis by the facilities committee or CSD CF depending on the situation One case where this may happen is when a faculty member has a last name matching an existing account or CS email alias belonging to a student or former student Also if an account and or CS email alias is not currently in use it is subject to change or elimination Disk quotas on Xenon Current CSD students get a 30 MB quota and 35 MB hard limit for home directories and 4 MB 5 MB for the mail spool directory Alumni get a 10 MB quota and 12 5 MB hard limit for home directories and 3 MB 4 MB for the mail spool directory Quotas may also be in place on temporary directories such as var tmp Use the command quota v to view your quotas and usage Temporary files and automatic file deletion The following files will be automatically deleted at some point after they have reached the ages indicated based on modification time stamps Filename core one week core dump one week e g emacs autosave files one month e g emacs backup files tmp 10 hours and at every reboot var tmp one week Please do not use tmp for storing files tmp uses the swap partition which is of limited capacity and tmp is cleared on every reboot You can use var tmp for storing files temporarily Do not abuse this option Anyone abusing this option may have his or her

programs Absolutely no IRC private HTTP server or any continuously CPU intensive programs are allowed on Xenon Such programs found running on Xenon will be killed Repeated abuse will be grounds for an account being removed Faculty members who want an account on Xenon will get one Currently the faculty quotas are the same as the student quotas Accounts are private Sharing accounts between users is not allowed and will result in the account being removed Avoiding mail problems from quotas Please keep your mail files under half of your hard quota limit to allow for manipulating mail Move your mail to your home directory after you read it Most mailers can do that for you Large mail folders will be moved to users home directories If your mail quota limit is reached mail will bounce and you may also have problems reading your mail Autologout when idle Users idle for over 24 hours will be logged out Logging out when idle Please log out when you are not using the system especially at night Logging out Before logging out always kill any programs you are running like emacs trn netscape etc and then exit from your shell before breaking your network connection to avoid leaving runaway

Research Cluster Policy Server Hosting University Policies Xenon Student Account Policies Research ClustersSAIL Compute Cluster Services The Team SAIL Compute Cluster Overview The Stanford AI Lab cluster aggregates research compute nodes from various groups within the lab and controls them via a central batch queueing system which coordinates all jobs running on the cluster The nodes should not be accessed directly as the scheduler is exclusively responsible for managing resources such as CPU Memory and GPU for each job Once you have access to use the cluster you can submit monitor and cancel jobs from the headnode sc stanford edu This machine should not be used for any compute intensive work however you can get a shell on a compute node simply by starting an interactive job You may also monitor read only your jobs and the status of the cluster using the web based dashboard at https sc stanford edu You can use the cluster by starting batch jobs or interactive jobs Interactive jobs give you access to a shell on one of the nodes from which you can execute commands by hand whereas batch jobs run from a given shell script in the background and automatically terminate when finished If you encounter any problems using the cluster please send us a request via http support cs stanford edu being as specific as you can when describing the issue Usage Policy To gain access to the cluster please have your advisor or one of your research group leaders submit a request via http support cs stanford edu stating the following your CS login ID name of the advisor you re working with and put them under cc on the form and estimated access expiration date By default there is no sharing of compute resources between partitions in other words only use partition s and compute resources from your own group For collaboration please present us with written approval by your collaborators and their advisors If we observe deliberate abuse attempts the incident will be reported and may incur negative consequences Access to the headnode sc stanford edu is only available on the Stanford Network or via the Stanford VPN service You will need to put the VPN in full tunnel mode not split tunnl If we have any trouble with your job we will try to get in touch with you but we reserve the right to kill your jobs at any time In particular these machines are intended for compute intensive jobs only They must not be used to engage in heavy I O operations or to crawl or scrape data from the internet For those tasks see the Dedicated data transfer node section below If you have questions about the cluster send us a request at http support cs stanford edu Job Submissions Use of the cluster is coordinated by a batch queue scheduler which assigns compute nodes to jobs in an order that depends on various factors such as the time submitted the number of nodes requested the availability of the resources being requested etc GPU Memory There are two basic types of jobs to the cluster interactive and batch Interactive jobs give you access to a shell on one of the nodes from which you can execute commands by hand whereas batch jobs run from a given shell script in the background and automatically terminate when finished Generally speaking interactive jobs are used for building prototyping and testing while batch jobs are used thereafter Batch Jobs Batch jobs are the preferred way to interact with the cluster and are useful when you do not need to interact with the shell to perform the desired task Two clear advantages are that your job will be managed automatically after submission and that placing your setup commands in a shell script lets you efficiently dispatch multiple similar jobs To start a simple batch job on a partition group you work with see bottom of the page ssh into sc and type sbatch my script sh There are many parameters you can define based on your requirement You can reference to a sample submit script I have via sailhome software sample batch sh For further documentation on submitting batch jobs via Slurm see the online sbatch documentation via SchedMD Our friends at the Stanford Research Computing Center who runs the Sherlock cluster via Slurm also has a wonderful write up and they largely applies to us too Sherlock Cluster Interactive Jobs Interactive jobs are useful for compiling and prototyping code intended to run on the cluster performing one time tasks and executing software that requires runtime feedback To start an interactive job ssh into sc and type srun partition mypartition pty bash The above will allocate a node in mypartition and drop you into a bash shell You can also add other parameter as necessary srun partition mypartition nodelist node1 gres gpu 1 pty bash The above will allocate node1 in mypartition with 1 GPU and drop you into a bash shell If you need X11 forwarding please make sure you have XServer installed such as XQuartz and add x11 to your srun command srun partition mypartition nodelist node1 gres gpu 1 pty x11 xclock GPU specifics User can request for a specific type of GPU or specify a memory constraint if they choose to srun partition mypartition gres gpu titanx 1 pty bash The above will request 1 TitanX GPU from any nodes in mypartition srun partition mypartition gres gpu 1 constraint 12G pty bash The above will request 1 GPU with 12G VRAM from any nodes in mypartition Of course this varies from partition to partition depending on their hardware configurations Please visit https sc stanford edu and click on Partition on the top right you can see the types of GPU available for each partition there As for constraint you can refer to the specification by Nvidia 1080ti 11G titan 12G etc For further documentation on the srun command see the online srun documentation via SchedMD Managing Jobs One tool we found very useful and installed on SC cluster is pestat https github com OleHolmNielsen Slurm tools tree master pestat It gives you an overview of the entire cluster or just a specific partition node user line by line Status of each node on the cluster pestat G Status of each node within a partition pestat p mypartition G Status of a specific node pestat n mynode G List nodes that has a job owned by a specific user pestat u myuser G You can also use standard Slurm command to view a list of all jobs running on the cluster by typing squeue You can view detailed information for a specific job by typing scontrol show job jobid To cancel a job you started type scancel jobid There is also a Slurm web dashboard if you prefer at https sc stanford edu note this is only accessible from within Stanford network or via Stanford VPN A good comparison between torque pbs command vs Slurm please head to https www sdsc edu hocks FG PBS slurm html Storage There are several storage options for the scail cluster Home directory sailhome csid All sc cluster nodes mount a common network volumes for your home directory This is a good option for submission scripts outputs etc there is a quota of 20GB for each user Scratch Storage via NFS Each group has their own network storage mounted via auto fs meaning it mounts only when you reference the path Space amounts vary from group to group so ask your group for details or contact us if you are not sure where to store your files Dedicated data transfer node scdt stanford edu Since we want to keep resource contention to the minimum we have a dedicated machine for handling data I Os or access to off campus resources If you need to move large amount of data or have any prolonged I O operations please do so on SCDT scdt stanford edu Because this machine is equipped with higher bandwidth interfaces and mounts all network storage within the cluster it is also much more likely to be faster to do it here than anywhere else FAQ Partition Defaults A number of global defaults should be made aware of Memory per job 4GB user can specify more via mem Core per job 2 user can specify more via cpus per task Walltime varies by partitions check https sc stanford edu Partition Most are 7days user can specify upto 21days via time Screen TMUX We see many users wrap their interactive jobs with screen or tmux so they can detach and re attach later While this is a feasible use case we want to state that if there s any network interruption between the headnode sc and the compute nodes and they do happen occasionally these jobs will get cancelled automatically by Slurm Jobs submitted via sbatch on the other hand can better sustain these kind of interruptions Virtual Environment for Python Almost all users are using some kind of virtual python environment either virtualenv anaconda miniconda etc We install a small number of default python packages to get things going but you are responsible for creating your own environment CUDA CuDNN At the moment CUDA 9 0 is the default across the cluster But each group partition can have their own default Contact us if you think the group is ready for a new version of CUDA which can be added multiple CUDA versions can co exist this often requires GPU driver update which requires a reboot on all of the nodes iPython Jupyter Notebook Do not run iPython Jupyter notebook on the headnode can cause memory spikes instead do that via one of the compute node ssh sc stanford edu screen srun p mypartition pty bash add gres gpu 1 if you need GPU export XDG RUNTIME DIR important source yourvirtualenvironment jupyter notebook no browser port 8880 ip 0 0 0 0 Follow the result URL on your browser to open up your notebook Extra credit If you

Academic Requirements YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE ACADEMIC REQUIREMENTS CHECKLIST FOR THE PH D DEGREE 1 CS300 seminar The CS300 seminar is offered to incoming first year students in Autumn Quarter The seminar gives CS faculty the opportunity to speak for 45 minutes about their research The idea is to allow the new CS Ph D students the chance to learn about the professor s areas of research before permanently aligning First year CS PhD students are required to attend 2 3 of the seminars To record your attendance to the seminars please go to http cs stanford edu webdb cs300 and log in using your CS ID and password 2 First Year Research Rotation Program Ph D students rotate through multiple research groups in their first year You do a small research project or help someone on one each quarter The goals are for you to start research immediately to learn some research skills and what each research group is like and for them to learn about you Research rotations are used in many other departments such as the various biosciences and physics departments at Stanford Most students find them an invaluable opportunity to form strong relationships with multiple faculty and students in different research groups to learn skills that will help them in their future research and to get a better understanding of which research group they d like to belong to for their Ph D research The goal of the rotation program is to find a permanent advisor by the middle of Spring quarter of the first year You should make sure that by the end of the year there s at least one faculty member who is impressed with you and with whom you d like to work For information on how the process works refer to https cs stanford edu academics phd first year research rotation program 3 Courses A student should plan and successfully complete a coherent program of study covering the basic areas of Computer Science and related disciplines The student s advisor has primary responsibility for the adequacy of the program The University has two main requirements related to courses First each student must complete 135 course units not including athletics and performing art classes for graduation CS Ph D students take 8 10 units 8 is the minimum requirment and 10 units is maximum tuition level for 8 10 is the same a quarter Credit for graduate work done elsewhere up to a maximum of 45 course units may be applied to graduation requirements Second students must take courses from at least 4 different faculty members There are NO courses specifically required by the Computer Science Department except for the 1 unit CS300 seminar and CS499 Advanced Reading Research or equivalent The CS300 seminar is only offered Autumn Quarter and is required of all first year Ph D students Students are required to attend 2 3 of the total number of sessions in order to get credit for the class Note All PhD students are required to enroll in at least 3 units of CS499 for all quarters The university requires PhD students to maintain a 3 0 GPA overall for confering your degree See https studentaffairs stanford edu registrar students graduate minimum International students The Computer Science Dept allows only up to a maximum of 3 units of Curriculum Practical Training CPT in the entire academic career CS390 A B and C may each be taken once full time part time Full time internships are allowed only during summer quarter For more details contact phdstudentservices cs stanford edu 4 Breadth Requirements The purpose of the Breadth Requirement for the Doctoral program is to ensure that each graduate of the program has adequate knowledge of the core areas in the field of Computer Science The Breadth Requirements are divided into 3 areas Mathematical Theoretical Foundations Computer Systems and Artificial Intelligence Applications You need to pass 2 subareas within each of the 3 areas Each of the 6 passes can be achieved in one of three ways Take a breadth course as listed below and earn a letter grade of A or better in the class es You can apply for a waiver based on comparable coursework taken elsewhere If you are waiving coursework please contact the designated approver and cc phdstudentservices cs after filling out the Ph D Breadth Waiver Form The approver may question the student about both the content of the class and their understanding of the material At the discretion of the breadth area approver a student can successfully complete the exams or portions of the exams of an associated class or any other appropriate evaluation and receive a Breadth Area Pass The Breadth Area Pass is determined by the breadth area approver like past comp pass fail decisions but should generally mean work at a level similar to students getting an A in an associated class For more information on clearing breadth requirements click here Approved breadth area courses and approvers are Area A Mathematical and Theoretical FoundationsA Analysis of Algorithms CS161 CS168 CS261 CS265 Moses Charikar

series CS347 Michael Bernstein 5 Candidacy You are eligible to apply for candidacy Once you have a permanent advisor Have completed the six breadth requirements two from each of the three areas and Have completed at least a three unit course with each of four instructors who are members of the Academic Council Candidacy makes you eligible for a larger stipend and sets in motion your five year timeclock to complete the rest of your Ph D requirements All students must fulfill their breadth requirements and file for candidacy by the end of their second year in the program For detailed information on how to file for candidacy please see https stanford app box com v appcanddoct 6 Qualifying Examination The Qualifying Examination tests a student s depth of knowledge and familiarity in his or her area of specialization Qualifying Exams are generally offered in all areas covered by the written Comprehensive Exam It is possible for a student to request a Qualifying Exam in an area not already offered such as one that cuts across current divisions The feasibility of such a request is determined on a case by case basis by the Ph D Program Committee A student should pass a qualifying exam no later than the end of his or her third year A student may take the Qualifying exams only twice In some cases a conditional pass is awarded When the designated conditions have been met such as CA ing a certain class taking a course or reading additional material in a specific area the student is credited with the Pass If a student fails the Qualifying Exam a second time the Ph D Program Committee is contacted as this would mean that the student is not making reasonable progress This is cause for dismissal by default from the Ph D program The Qualifying Exams are a University requirement and are taken very seriously Therefore sufficient time and in depth preparation must be given to the Quals area that the student chooses to ensure success The format of the Qualifying Exams varies from year to year and area to area depending on the faculty member or Quals Chair in charge of each specific exam Examples are in class written exams take home written exams oral exams written assignments and or a combination of the above The Quals Chair administers the exams and the results must be submitted to the Ph D Program Officer for the required entry into the University s Axess PeopleSoft and departmental database systems Passing the Qualifying Exam certifies that the student is ready to begin dissertation work in the chosen area If a student wishes to do dissertation work in an area other than his her Qualifying Exam area the student s advisor and or the faculty in the new area will determine whether an additional exam is required 7 Teaching Requirement During his her academic career each student must complete at least 4 units as a course assistant CA or teaching fellow TF for courses in Computer Science that are numbered 100 or above Earning one unit means working 10 hours per week for one quarter A CA receives the same stipend and tuition benefit as an RA A TF receives a slightly higher stipend as s he is responsible for teaching a course 8 Thesis Proposal The student must present an oral thesis proposal and submit the form to their full Reading Committee by spring quarter of the fourth year The Thesis Proposal Form must be filled out signed and approved by all the members of the committee and submitted to the CS PhD Student Services in Gates 196 The goal of the Thesis Proposal is to enable students to get better formative feedback from their Reading Committee on what directions to take to successfully complete a quality dissertation The Thesis Proposal should allow plenty of time for discussion with the Reading Committee about the direction of the thesis research The suggested format should include A description of the research problem and its significance A description of previous work in the area and the state of the art prior to the student s work A description of preliminary work the student has done on the problem and any research results of that work An outline of remaining work to be done a timeline for accomplishing it 9 Reading Committee After passing the Qualifying Examination a student must secure the agreement of a member of the department faculty to act as the dissertation advisor Typically this is the program advisor but in some cases the dissertation advisor may be in another department In addition the student must form a Dissertation Reading Committee composed of the principal dissertation advisor and at least two additional readers The Reading Committee Form should be turned in no later than one year after passing a qualifying exam 9 1 Regulations Concerning Composition of Reading Committee The principal advisor and at least one of the other committee members must be Academic Council members This is a University regulation At least two committee members must be CS professors or joint CS professors academic council members i e Stanford faculty Courtesy CS professors do not count This is a departmental requirement The Reading Committee supervises the dissertation research advises the student evaluates the student s progress and signs the final draft of the dissertation These Committee Members also often serve on the student s Orals Committee because of their knowledge of his or her research 10 University Oral Examination The University requires an Oral Examination The department chooses the format of the University Oral In the Computer Science Department it is a Defense of the Dissertation Traditionally the format of the Oral is a public presentation lasting approximately one hour followed by questions from the examining committee in a private session Total time of 3 hours maximum The Orals committee must have at least five members that include one Chair and four voting members Four of the five must be Academic Council members The Orals committee will consist of the following Chair the Chair of the Orals Committee is selected by the student usually at the suggestion of Reading Committee members The chair must be an Academic Council member and may be a Professor Emeritus The chair may not have a full or joint appointment in the adviser s or student s department but may have a courtesy appointment in the department The chair can be from the same department as any other member s of the examination committee and can be from the student s minor department provided that the student s adviser does not have a full or joint appointment in the minor department In order to maintain impartiality the orals chair may not simultaneously serve on the student s dissertation reading committee Reading Committee members and or the student s proposed Orals Committee members offer help and suggestions for a possible Chair Advisor The student s advisor is a member of the committee Readers The members of the student s Reading Committee usually serve on the Orals Committee Readers who are not Academic Council members limit 1 need prior approval from the Graduate Division to sit on the Orals Committee by filing a Petition Form along with the Orals Form Orals may be scheduled any time after a substantial portion of the dissertation is complete We encourage students to schedule the exam during the quarter preceding the one in which they intend to submit the final draft This allows time for post Oral revision of the document and will prevent added stress or disappointment in not being conferred as planned A student must submit a University Oral Exam Schedule form at least two weeks before the proposed Orals date The Ph D Program Officer will make sure that the committee is properly composed Along with the form the student should have a draft of the dissertation available in case the University chair desires more detailed information The student must submit an abstract of the dissertation to the Ph D Program Officer The University prefers that Orals not be scheduled during the first two weeks of the quarter finals week or during breaks Students should plan the schedule of their Orals well in advance 11 Dissertation The most important requirement for the Ph D degree is the dissertation The dissertation must be accepted by the student s Reading Committee The Graduate Degree Progress office in the Registrar s Office distributes a comprehensive list of directions concerning preparation and submission of the final draft You have the option of submitting the dissertation online See the Registrar s Dissertation and Thesis

dinner together when I visited Huawei in 2018 and we talked about Tong s efforts with his Huawei and Tsinghua colleagues to design a new acknowledgment scheme for TCP Tong ended up developing TACK in part by iterating its design on our Pantheon of Congestion Control a testbed that included nodes with cellular connectivity around the world and until 2020 ran automated bake offs every week and published the resulting packet traces Tong deployed 16 different versions of the TACK scheme on the Pantheon as the system collected many gigabytes of packet traces throughout 2018 and 2019 The TACK

Community Award Francis and our co authors set up a website that streamed 38 years of video to 63 500 users over the course of a year we found that variability and therefore statistical uncertainty is bigger than had been documented calling into question the reliability of some past research in this area and that dumb ABR schemes may be able to outperform some more sophisticated schemes We describe a way of learning in place in situ that appears to alleviate at least partly some of the pitfalls that have afflicted other ML approaches The website is still live and we welcome contributions from researchers who would like to evaluate or develop new algorithms for ABR selection throughput prediction or congestion control We also welcome contributions from viewers who would like to contribute

vision computations given three constraints limited compute power or actual power on a device limited communications capacity off the device and limited tolerance for end to end loss e g classification mistakes To me one of the biggest contributions our paper made may have been in the axes the idea that given equal end to end accuracy or at least an equal tolerance for loss there is a tradeoff between the need for local compute on the x axis above and communication y axis and that schemes should be evaluated in this way and viewed as part of a tradeoff space July 2019 Sadjad

billion in sales and market value But a different way to analyze the same data a Bayesian way finds that the drug actually reduces heart attacks Or does it We often hear of this conflict between Bayesian and frequentist statistics But much of the conflict is misguided Viewed formally on the same axes the two schools of statistics turn out to share a tight symmetry Criticisms of each can be

Joshua Ma Ameesh Goyal Jo o Batalha and Hari Balakrishnan Protocol Design Contests SIGCOMM Computer Communications Review July 2014 We ran an in class contest to develop a congestion control algorithm asking 40 students in a graduate networking class to develop protocols that would outperform Sprout Spurred on by a live leaderboard the students submitted 3 000 candidate algorithms that mapped a region of realizable throughput vs delay tradeoffs The winners became co authors on an article describing the contest and their winning entries May 2014 My doctoral dissertation Transport

Silver Bullet Extending SDN to the Data Plane in HotNets 2013 College Park Md November 2013 Working with my colleagues Anirudh Sivaraman and Suvinay Subramanian we demonstrated bidirectional cyclic preference loops among three popular algorithms that control queueing and scheduling behavior within a packet switched network Our thesis no such scheme can remain dominant as application objectives evolve so routers and switches should be programmable in this respect August 2013 TCP ex Machina Computer Generated Congestion Control in SIGCOMM 2013 Hong Kong China August 2013 Remy is a computer program that creates TCP congestion control algorithms from first principles given uncertain prior knowledge about the network and an objective to achieve I used to say that these computer generated schemes can outperform their human generated forebears even ones that benefit from running code inside the network I should have been equally emphatic that it matters a lot how the designer specifies their assumption and how closely those assumptions are met by the real network The real contribution here I think was in the idea that the design of a CC algorithm can be the product of reinforcement learning a process where the emphasis is appropriately on the designer s assumptions and goals and less so on the mechanism Joint work with my advisor Hari Balakrishnan April 2013 Sprout Stochastic Forecasts Achieve High Throughput and Low Delay over Cellular Networks in USENIX NSDI 2013 Lombard Ill April 2013 won 2014 Applied Networking Research Prize We showed that on today s cellular networks

contending only with nonresponsive cross traffic The workshop paper that eventually became Remy Joint work with Hari Balakrishnan October 2009 False positive rate for Barnard s test for superiority at nominal 0 05 alpha red vs modified test blue informed by prior that true value lies within shaded region Developed exchange algorithm to calculate the coverage probability and false positive rate of exact 2x2 confidence intervals and hypothesis tests Typically these tests e g Barnard s test for superiority the Chan test for non inferiority take 5 10 minutes to run at sample sizes of 1000x1000 in software like StatXAct The exchange algorithm calculates the whole tableau all 1001x1001 outcomes in the same difficulty as the hardest single p value or confidence interval Much similar work had been done for one dimensional tests and intervals but the two dimensional case had previously been intractable This technique allows us to empirically test traditional statistical rules of thumb like the appropriateness of the chi square test when E n p 5 or the notion that exact tests are unnecessarily conservative It also allows us to design new tests and intervals that minimize conservatism and ripple The above graph shows the benefit of applying a prior to classical frequentist inference Barnard s test for superiority controls false positives unconditionally the red line is always below 0 05 but at a cost of conservatism in the region of p 0 35 We find that if we are able to state a region where the parameter is assumed to lie a priori we can produce a modified hypothesis test with better performance inside that region May 2006 English Text Classification by Authorship and Date class project The n grams used by the U S Supreme Court evolve quickly enough that it s possible to

DeepDive is a new type of system to extract value from dark data Like dark matter dark data is the great mass of data buried in text tables figures and images which lacks structure and so is essentially unprocessable by existing data systems DeepDive s most popular use case is to transform the dark data of web pages pdfs and other databases into rich SQL style databases In turn these databases can be used to support both SQL style and predictive analytics Recently some DeepDive based applications have exceeded the quality of human volunteer annotators in both precision and recall for complex scientific articles Data produced by DeepDive is used by several law enforcement agencies and NGOs to fight human trafficking The technical core of DeepDive is an engine that combines extraction integration and prediction into a single engine with probabilistic inference as its core operation A one pager with key design highlights is here PaleoDeepDive is featured in the July 2015 issue of Nature DeepDive is our attempt to understand a new type of database system Our new approach can be summarized as follows the data the output of various tools the input from users including the program the developer writes are observations from which the system statistically infers the answer This view is a radical departure from traditional data processing systems which assume that the data is one hundred percent correct A key problem in DeepDive is that the system needs to consider many possible interpretations for each data item In turn we need to explore a huge number of combinations during probabilistic inference which is one of the core technical challenges Our goal is to acquire more sources of data for DeepDive to understand more deeply to change the way that science and industry operate 2 Fundamentals of Data Processing Almost all data processing systems have their intellectual roots in first order logic The most computationally expensive and most interesting operation in such systems is the relational join Recently I helped discover the first join algorithm with optimal worst case running time This result uses a novel connection between logic combinatorics and geometry We are using this connection to develop new attacks on classical problems in listing patterns in graphs and in statistical inference Two threads have emerged The first theme is that these new worst case optimal algorithms are fundamentally different from the algorithms used in most of today s data processing systems Although our algorithm is optimal in the worst case commercial relational database engines have been tuned to work well on real data sets by smart people for about four decades And so a difficult question is how does one translate these insights into real data processing systems The second theme is that we may need new techniques to get theoretical results strong enough to guide practice As a result I ve started thinking about beyond worst case analysis and things like conditioning for combinatorial problems to hopefully build theory that can inform practice to a greater extent The first papers have just been posted Demos Examples and Papers Worst case Optimal Joins We have posted a survey for SIGMOD record about recent advances in join algorithms Our goal is to give a high level view of the results for practitioners and applied researchers We also managed to simplify the arguments A full version of our join algorithm with worst case optimal running time is here The LogicBlox guys have their own commercial worst case optimal algorithm Our new system EmptyHeaded is based on this theory Beyond Worst case Joins This work is our attempt to go beyond worst case analysis for join algorithms We with Dung Nguyen develop a new algorithm that we call Minesweeper based on these ideas The main theoretical idea is to formalize the amount of work any algorithm spends certifying using a set of propositional statements that the output set is complete and not say a proper subset We call this set of propositions the certificate We manage to establish a dichotomy theorem for this stronger notion of complexity if a query is what Ron Fagin calls beta acyclic then Minesweeper runs in time linear in the certificate if a query is beta cyclic than on some instance any algorithm takes time that is super linear in the certificate The results get sharper and more fun Almost to one algorithm to rule them all We have a much better description of beyond worst case optimality with a resolution framework and a host of new results for different indexing strategies This paper supercedes many of the results in Minesweeper and in a much nicer way We also hope to connect more of geometry and resolution but we ll see A first part of our attack on conditioning for combinatorial problems is in NIPS and on Arxiv It is not difficult to get me interested in a theory problem Ask around the Infolab if you don t believe me Our goal is to

https://cs.stanford.edu/people/trippel/ ##### Caroline Trippel Caroline Trippel Assistant Professor Computer Science Electrical Engineering Departments Stanford University Research Publications Awards Honors Press Contact Research I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Electrical Engineering Departments at Stanford University Prior to starting at Stanford I spent nine months as a Research Scientist at Facebook in the FAIR SysML group My research interests are in the area of computer architecture with a focus on promoting correctness and security as first order computer systems design metrics akin to performance and power A central theme of my work is leveraging formal methods techniques to design and verify hardware systems in order to ensure that they can provide correctness and security guarantees for the applications they intend to support I have been recently exploring the role of architecture in enabling privacy preserving machine learning the role of machine learning in hardware systems optimizations particularly in the context of neural recommendation and opportunities for improving datacenter and at scale machine learning reliability My research has influenced the design of the RISC V ISA memory consistency model both via my formal analysis of its draft specification and my subsequent participation in the RISC V Memory Model Task Group Additionally my work produced a novel methodology and tool that synthesized two new variants of the now famous Meltdown and Spectre attacks My research has been recognized with IEEE Top Picks distinctions and the 2020 ACM SIGARCH IEEE CS TCCA Outstanding Dissertation Award I was also awarded an NVIDIA Graduate Fellowship 2017 2018 and selected to attend the 2018 MIT Rising Stars in EECS Workshop I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Princeton University and my BS in Computer Engineering at Purdue University Prospective students I am currently looking for motivated graduate students postdoctoral scholars and undergraduate researchers Once admitted to Stanford if you are interested in working with me please send me an email with your CV to start a conversation Curriculum

high performance visual computing systems that enable new more advanced computer graphics and visual perception applications Our recent research efforts can be categorized into several themes Enabling Efficient Image Video Processing at Scale Emerging visual computing applications require efficient analysis and mining of large repositories of visual data images videos RGBD We are developing a distributed computing support for applications that query analyze and mine image and video collections at the scale of thousands of cloud CPUs or hundreds of GPUs See the Scanner website for more detail Optimizing Compilers for Accelerated Hardware We ve recently developed techniques for automatically scheduling image processing pipelines onto CPUs GPUs and are working on systems that generate specialized hardware implementations for FPGAs or ASICs DNN Model Design for Efficient Inference Since building efficient systems involves both efficient hardware and efficient algorithms we are exploring DNN designs that achieve higher accuracy per unit cost using techniques such as conditional DNN execution and specialization to video stream contents I m always looking for great students that wish to work on these topics or bring their own ideas I gave an Arch 2030 workshop keynote on how visual computing applications will drive architectual innovation in the year 2030 The talk is on

extends HLSL with new capabilities for building modular extensible and high performance real time shading systems Slang is now the shading language for NVIDIA s Falcor research rendering system See the Slang website or the SIGGRAPH 2018 paper for more Self Refining Interactive Games graphics with 100 s of machines and a lot of latency How do we build platforms that take graphics applications from one user on a single GPU to 10 000 machines and one million users in the cloud Even though computer graphics has always been at the vanguard of parallel computing there has been little success using modern cloud based computing resources to improve interactive experiences In this project we asked the question how could we leverage the massive storage and batch processing capabilities of the cloud to generate new forms of interactive worlds and we took a precompute everything approach to doing so Since one cannot precompute everything about an complex interactive world the challenge is to determine what is most important to precompute so these parts can be presented to the user with the highest quality graphics We find that by recording statistics of users playing a game we can build a model of user behavior and then concentrate large scale cloud based precomputation of graphics and physics around the states that users are most likely to encounter The result is a self refining game whose dynamics improve with play ultimately providing realistically rendered rich fluid dynamics in real time on a mobile device For more detail see our work applied these ideas to cloth simulation and fluid simulation A Real Time Micropolygon Rendering Pipeline evolving the GPU pipeline for tiny triangles GPUs will soon have the compute horsepower to render scenes containing cinematic quality surfaces in real time Unfortunately if they render these subpixel polygons micropolygons using the same techniques as they do for large triangles today GPUs will perform extremely inefficiently Instead of trying to parallelize Pixar s Reyes micropolygon rendering system we re taking a hard look at how the existing Direct3D 11 rendering pipeline and GPU hardware implementations must evolve to render micropolygon workloads efficiently in a high throughput system Changes to software interfaces algorithms and HW design are fair game Slides describing what we ve learned can be found in this SIGGRAPH course talk or in my dissertation Evolving the Real Time Graphics Pipeline for Micropolygon Rendering GRAMPS a framework for heterogeneous parallel programming There are two ways to think about GRAMPS Graphics folks should think of GRAMPS as a system for building custom graphics pipelines We simply gave up on adding more and more configurable knobs to existing pipelines like OpenGL Direct3D and instead allow the programmer to programmatically define a custom pipeline with an arbitrary number of stages connected by queues To non graphics folks GRAMPS is a stream programming system that embraces heterogeneity in underlying architecture and anticipates streaming workloads that exhibit both regular and irregular dynamic behavior The GRAMPS runtime dynamically schedules GRAMPS programs onto architectures containing a mixture of compute optimized cores generic CPU cores and fixed function processing units The Sequoia Programming Language Programming the Memory Hierarchy Sequoia is a hierarchical stream programming language that arose from the observation that expressing locality not parallelism is the most important responsibility of parallel application programmers in scientific numerical domains Sequoia presents a parallel machine as an abstract hierarchy of memories and gives the programmer explicit control over data locality and communication through this hierarchy using first class language constructs basically Sequoia supports nested kernels and streams of streams Sequoia programs have run on a variety of exposed communication architectures such as clusters the CELL processor GPUs and even supercomputing clusters at Los Alamos The best way to learn about Sequoia is to read our SC06 paper Brook Merrimac stream processing for scientific computing I helped out with the BrookGPU abstracting the GPU as a stream processor for numerical computing and Merrimac Streaming Supercomputer projects Brook was the academic precursor to

how proud we are of each and every one of you Free Stanford Alumni Association Membership for 2020 Graduates The Stanford Alumni Association is offering a free lifetime membership to all Class of 2020 graduates Details are here https alumni stanford edu get page membership faq newgrads Congratulations to the Following Award Recipients Danqi Chen Arthur Samuel Best Doctoral Thesis Award The Arthur Samuel Best Doctoral Thesis Award has been awarded to Danqi Chen In her dissertation thesis Neural Reading Comprehension and Beyond Danqi Chen developed key approaches for using neural networks for reading comprehension and question answering Her attention based reading comprehension system the Stanford Attentive Reader was one of the earliest such systems Danqi s dissertation was then first in showing how such a neural system could be built out into a complete open domain large text collection question answering system the technology that underlies general systems for question answering which are increasingly being deployed in web search engines Sarah Tollman The Christofer Stephenson Memorial Award for Graduate Research The Christofer Stephenson Memorial Award for Graduate Research has been awarded to Sarah Tollman for her thesis Understanding Egalitarian Paxos and Using Synchronized Clocks to Increase Commutativity for Geo Replication Sarah s thesis work began with a simple goal of reproducing previously published measurements of the EPaxos consensus algorithm as a first step in a larger project However her initial measurements raised unexpected questions As she dug deeper to answer those questions she discovered more and more surprising behaviors Her relentless pursuit of answers led eventually to a very different approach to measuring the performance of EPaxos with conclusions different from the published ones She also implemented improvements to EPaxos including a new technique that uses synchronized clocks to reduce the system s conflict rate Mario Srouji The Christofer Stephenson Memorial Award for Graduate Research The Christofer Stephenson Memorial Award for Graduate Research has been awarded to Mario Srouji for his thesis Auto SQED Automated Symbolic Quick Error Detection SQED for Formal Verification Mario s work is in the critical area of hardware verification making sure that new electronic designs work correctly He built a tool that dramatically reduces the manual effort required to apply a powerful verification technique called Symbolic Quick Error Detection SQED Previously applying SQED required writing hundreds of lines of highly complex code customized for specific hardware designs and their idiosyncrasies Such approaches require significant manual work and are error prone Mario s contribution now makes it possible to automate almost all of this only requiring that a circuit designer fill out a short structured template This significantly lowers the barrier to entry for research and industry teams to leverage the power of SQED verification which will help ensure that electronic systems including those we use every day are safe and reliable Maya Varma The Kennedy Thesis Prize The Ben Wegbreit Prize for Undergraduate CS Research The Firestone Medal for Excellence in Undergraduate Research Maya Varma won not one or two but three awards for her honors thesis Artificial Intelligence Methods for Improved Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder Maya won the incredibly prestigious Kennedy Thesis Prize which is awarded to four students across the university Maya s paper was the top thesis across the fields of engineering and applied science Maya was also awarded the Firestone Medal for Excellence in Undergraduate Research which recognizes the top ten percent of all undergraduate honors theses Maya also won the Ben Wegbreit Prize for Undergraduate CS Research which goes to the top honors thesis in the CS Department Maya s thesis is special because it crosses disciplines through innovative methods to create solutions for a major health challenge It shows how to use computer science to better understand something as complex as autism and how to use artificial intelligence to help families manage the condition Maya is special because she cares not just about the science but the humans her science will impact She is talented and brilliant yet remains humble and true to a pure path that will inspire generations of students to follow in her footsteps Alexandra Henzinger Firestone Medal for Excellence in Undergraduate Research The Ford Scholar Award Alexandra Henzinger won the Firestone Medal for Excellence in Undergraduate Research for her honors thesis Automating the Mapping of Computation and Data onto Heterogeneous Hardware as well as the Ford Scholar Award The Firestone Medal recognizes the top ten percent of all undergraduate honors theses Alexandra s thesis Alexandra displayed uncommon poise and creativity in tackling her honors thesis She took an ill formed problem and successfully clarified it and devised an elegant solution for efficiently searching a very large space with an unusual structure Beyond her conceptual insights the care that she took with the experimental work was essential to having a basis for understanding subtle issues that might have been missed otherwise Beyond the research itself she has been an excellent member of our research community always willing to help others Alexandra also won the Ford Scholar award The Ford Scholar Award goes to the five undergraduate students who have the top GPA in the School of Engineering and are pursuing an advanced degree This year 3 of the 5 award winners were CS graduates Sahaj Garg The Ford Scholar Award The Ford Scholar Award goes to the five undergraduate students who have the top

Machine Learning Group Gates 250 pliang cs stanford edu Publications CodaLab sfig Research My goal is to develop trustworthy systems that can communicate effectively with people and improve over time through interaction I broadly identify with the machine learning ICML NeurIPS and natural language processing ACL NAACL EMNLP communities Computers can do a lot but tapping into their full power requires the rather non trivial ability to program I m interested in building systems that learn to translate natural language descriptions e g in English or Chinese into programs e g in Python or C Such systems would unlock the full power of computing to a much wider audience A while back I wrote a friendly introduction to natural language interfaces XRDS magazine 2014 and a slightly more technical survey article on executable semantic parsing CACM 2016 One idea we ve explored is to naturalize a programming language gradually into a natural language ACL 2017 One can also use natural language to describe classifiers directly rather than requiring labeled data ACL 2018 The tension between the fuzziness of machine learning and the crispness of logic also fascinates me On this note we showed that neural networks can solve SAT problems with surprising accuracy despite not being told explicitly what a SAT problem is ICLR 2019 Despite the successes of machine learning otherwise high performing models are still difficult to debug and fail catastrophically in the presence of changing data distributions and adversaries For example on the SQuAD reading comprehension dataset we created EMNLP 2016 we showed that state of the art systems despite reaching human level benchmark performance are easily fooled by distracting sentences in a way that no human would be EMNLP 2017 Given society s increasing reliance on machine learning it is critical to build tools to make machine learning more reliable in the wild We ve worked on using influence functions to understand black box models ICML 2017 semidefinite programming to provide certificates a neural network is safe from a class of adversaries NeurIPS 2018 and distributionally robust optimization to ensure the fairness of machine learning models over time ICML 2018 Finally I am a strong proponent of efficient and reproducible research We have been developing CodaLab Worksheets a platform that allows researchers to run and manage their experiments by maintaining the full provenance of an experiment from raw data to final results Most of our recent papers have been published on CodaLab as executable papers We are

Office Gates 412 Curriculum Vit I m an assistant professor at Stanford CS where I work on computer systems and machine learning as part of Stanford DAWN I m also co founder and Chief Technologist of Databricks a data and AI platform startup Before joining Stanford I was an assistant professor at MIT Interests I m interested in computer systems for emerging large scale workloads such as machine learning big data analytics and cloud computing In DAWN we re working on infrastructure for usable machine learning to make it dramatically easier to bring ML applications to production these issues are often much larger obstacles than ML algorithms in practice My work includes software runtimes quality assurance tools and systems optimizations for ML Beyond usability I am intersted in data privacy as the flipside to big data and have worked on systems that can provide scalable privacy for communication Internet queries and SaaS applications Impact Our group works closely with the open source community to test and publish our ideas During my PhD I started the Apache Spark project which is now one of the most widely used frameworks for distributed data processing and co started other widely used datacenter software such as Apache Mesos Alluxio and Spark Streaming At Stanford we developed DAWNBench a machine learning performance competition that drew submissions from the top industry groups and influenced the industry standard MLPerf and we are continuing to develop open source software such as Weld Sparser NoScope and MacroBase DIFF Some of our work has been featured in

pixel 296KB or 3337 x 2090 pixel 775 KB version of this fragment mosaiced from several high resolution photographs A collage showing 1 163 of the 1 186 fragments that exist Click here for a 1750 x 1188 pixel 598 KB or 3500 x 2376 pixel 2 2 MB version or the 6800 x 4152 pixel original using Zoomify EZ Versione Italiana News flashes 6 1 05 Our 3D models and photographs of all 1 186 fragments are now online viewable by the public and freely licensable to scholars 5 11 05 Two new papers one describing the entire project at a high level and the other describing new fragment matches we have found Overview of the project The Forma Urbis Romae also known as the Severan Marble Plan is a giant marble map of ancient Rome Measuring 60 feet wide by 45 feet high and dating to the reign of Septimius Severus circa 200 A D it is probably the single most important document on ancient Roman topography Unfortunately the map lies in fragments 1 186 of them and these fragments cover only a fraction of the original map surface Piecing this jigsaw puzzle together has been one of the great unsolved problems of classical archaeology The fragments of the Forma Urbis present many clues to the would be puzzle solver the pattern of surface incisions the 2D and 3D shapes of the border surfaces the thickness and physical characteristics of the fragments the direction of marble veining matches to excavations in the modern city and so on Unfortunately finding new fits among the fragments is difficult because they are large heavy and numerous We believe that the best hope for piecing the map together lies in using computer shape matching algorithms to search for matches among the fractured side surfaces of the fragments In order to test this idea we need 3D geometric models of every fragment of the map To obtain this data during June of 1999 a team of faculty and students from Stanford University spent a month in Rome digitizing the shape and surface appearance of every known fragment of the map using laser scanners and digital color cameras Our raw data consists of 8 billion polygons and 6 thousand color images occupying 40 gigabytes The goals of the Digital Forma Urbis Romae Project are threefold to assemble our raw range and color data into a set of 3D polygon mesh models and high resolution mosaiced photographs one for each of the 1 186 fragments of the map to develop new shape matching algorithms that are suitable for finding fits between 3D models whose surfaces are defined by polygon meshes and to use these algorithms to try solving the puzzle of the Forma Urbis Romae Whether or not we succeed in solving the puzzle one of the tangible results of this project will be a web accessible relational database giving descriptions and bibliographic information about each fragment and including links to our 3D models and photographs This project is sponsored by the National Science Foundation under the name Solving the Puzzle of the Forma Urbis Romae Some of the early work was funded under an NSF Digital Libraries Initiative pilot grant called Creating Digital Archives of 3D Artworks Other early funding came from Stanford University Interval Research Corporation the Paul G Allen Foundation for the Arts the Mellon Foundation the City of Rome and Pierluigi Zappacosta Current status of the project As of June 2005 we have assembled 3D models for all of the fragments representing about 8 billion polygons we have built a database giving scholars full access to these models and we have created a separate database that gives the general public viewing access to the models Click here for a description of and access to these two databases Unfortunately due to slight miscalibration of one of our laser scanners in Italy we have high resolution 0 25 mm models for only about 800 of these fragments For the remaining 400 we have a high resolution model of the top incised surface and a low resolution model 1 2 mm of the full fragment Although we no longer have funding to improve these models we welcome proposals from any research group or institution that wishes to help us with this task Since scanning large objects at high resolution will always yield datasets with slight calibration errors developing principled methods for overcoming these errors would be worthwhile research and good solutions would undoubtedly be publishable In addition we have found about 20 40 matches between fragments of the map depending on how many you believe These matches are described in this paper to appear in Bullettino Della Commissione Archeologica Comunale di Roma in 2005 A description of the first match we found in the Circus Maximus is included in the second photographic essay below People Computer Science Department

dinner together when I visited Huawei in 2018 and we talked about Tong s efforts with his Huawei and Tsinghua colleagues to design a new acknowledgment scheme for TCP Tong ended up developing TACK in part by iterating its design on our Pantheon of Congestion Control a testbed that included nodes with cellular connectivity around the world and until 2020 ran automated bake offs every week and published the resulting packet traces Tong deployed 16 different versions of the TACK scheme on the Pantheon as the system collected many gigabytes of packet traces throughout 2018 and 2019 The TACK

Community Award Francis and our co authors set up a website that streamed 38 years of video to 63 500 users over the course of a year we found that variability and therefore statistical uncertainty is bigger than had been documented calling into question the reliability of some past research in this area and that dumb ABR schemes may be able to outperform some more sophisticated schemes We describe a way of learning in place in situ that appears to alleviate at least partly some of the pitfalls that have afflicted other ML approaches The website is still live and we welcome contributions from researchers who would like to evaluate or develop new algorithms for ABR selection throughput prediction or congestion control We also welcome contributions from viewers who would like to contribute

vision computations given three constraints limited compute power or actual power on a device limited communications capacity off the device and limited tolerance for end to end loss e g classification mistakes To me one of the biggest contributions our paper made may have been in the axes the idea that given equal end to end accuracy or at least an equal tolerance for loss there is a tradeoff between the need for local compute on the x axis above and communication y axis and that schemes should be evaluated in this way and viewed as part of a tradeoff space July 2019 Sadjad

42 medical studies from the Web site of drug giant GlaxoSmithKline combined them in a meta analysis and found that Avandia the world s best selling diabetes drug caused heart attacks GSK lost about 12 billion in sales and market value But a different way to analyze the same data a Bayesian way finds that the drug actually reduces heart attacks Or does it We often hear of this conflict between Bayesian and frequentist statistics But much of the conflict is misguided Viewed formally on the same axes the two schools of statistics turn out to share a tight symmetry Criticisms of each can be transformed into a corresponding criticism of the other Slides from talk given at University of Chicago January 2009 U T Austin April 2011 MIT CSAIL October 2013 Boston Children s Hospital October

packet loss autocorrelated loss or intermittency varying bottlneck link capacity with a specified queue discipline etc Each one opens a container and affects processes launched within that container and the emulators can be nested arbitrarily inside each other to build up a chain of emulated effects Mahimahi is included in Debian and Ubuntu and has been used in a number of network research studies August 2014 Anirudh Sivaraman KW Pratiksha Thaker and Hari Balakrishnan An Experimental Study of the Learnability of Congestion Control in SIGCOMM 2014 Chicago Ill August 2014 Working with my colleagues Anirudh Sivaraman and Pratiksha Thaker we used the Remy automatic protocol design program as a tool to investigate the learnability of the Internet congestion control problem how easy is it to learn a network protocol to achieve desired goals given a necessarily imperfect model of the networks where it will ultimately be deployed July 2014 Anirudh Sivaraman KW Pauline Varley Somak Das Joshua Ma Ameesh Goyal Jo o Batalha and Hari Balakrishnan Protocol Design Contests SIGCOMM Computer Communications Review July 2014 We ran an in class contest to develop a congestion control algorithm asking 40 students in a graduate networking class to develop protocols that would outperform Sprout Spurred on by a live leaderboard the students submitted 3 000 candidate algorithms that mapped a region of realizable throughput vs delay tradeoffs The winners became co authors on an article describing the contest and their winning entries May 2014 My doctoral dissertation Transport

Silver Bullet Extending SDN to the Data Plane in HotNets 2013 College Park Md November 2013 Working with my colleagues Anirudh Sivaraman and Suvinay Subramanian we demonstrated bidirectional cyclic preference loops among three popular algorithms that control queueing and scheduling behavior within a packet switched network Our thesis no such scheme can remain dominant as application objectives evolve so routers and switches should be programmable in this respect August 2013 TCP ex Machina Computer Generated Congestion Control in SIGCOMM 2013 Hong Kong China August 2013 Remy is a computer program that creates TCP congestion control algorithms from first principles given uncertain prior knowledge about the network and an objective to achieve I used to say that these computer generated schemes can outperform their human generated forebears even ones that benefit from running code inside the network I should have been equally emphatic that it matters a lot how the designer specifies their assumption and how closely those assumptions are met by the real network The real contribution here I think was in the idea that the design of a CC algorithm can be the product of reinforcement learning a process where the emphasis is appropriately on the designer s assumptions and goals and less so on the mechanism Joint work with my advisor Hari Balakrishnan April 2013 Sprout Stochastic Forecasts Achieve High Throughput and Low Delay over Cellular Networks in USENIX NSDI 2013 Lombard Ill April 2013 won 2014 Applied Networking Research Prize We showed that on today s cellular networks with some simple inferential techniques it is possible to achieve 7 9 less delay than Skype Facetime and Google Hangout while achieving 2 4 the throughput of these applications at the same time We packaged the evaluation into one VM and held a contest for 40 students to try to find a better algorithm on the same conditions We were able to match the performance of the in network CoDel algorithm

Uncertainty about the Network State in HotNets 2011 Cambridge Mass November 2011 We show it is possible to produce reasonable transmission control from first principles and Bayesian inference when contending only with nonresponsive cross traffic The workshop paper that eventually became Remy Joint work with Hari Balakrishnan October 2009 False positive rate for Barnard s test for superiority at nominal 0 05 alpha red vs modified test blue informed by prior that true value lies within shaded region Developed exchange algorithm to calculate the coverage probability and false positive rate of exact 2x2 confidence intervals and hypothesis tests Typically these tests e g Barnard s test for superiority the Chan test for non inferiority take 5 10 minutes to run at sample sizes of 1000x1000 in software like StatXAct The exchange algorithm calculates the whole tableau all 1001x1001 outcomes in the same difficulty as the hardest single p value or confidence interval Much similar work had been done for one dimensional tests and intervals but the two dimensional case had previously been intractable This technique allows us to empirically test traditional statistical rules of thumb like the appropriateness of the chi square test when E n p 5 or the notion that exact tests are unnecessarily conservative It also allows us to design new tests and intervals that minimize conservatism and ripple The above graph shows the benefit of applying a prior to classical frequentist inference Barnard s test for superiority controls false positives unconditionally the red line is always below 0 05 but at a cost of conservatism in the region of p 0 35 We find that if we are able to state a region where the parameter is assumed to lie a priori we can produce a modified hypothesis test with better performance inside that region May 2006 English Text Classification by Authorship and Date class project The n grams used by the U S Supreme Court evolve quickly enough that it s possible to

http://cs.stanford.edu/degrees/undergrad/Requirements.shtml ##### Stanford University Undergraduate Major in Computer Science Home Declaring The Major Program Sheets The Minor The Coterm Petitions Transfer Credit Events Who To See Course and Requirement Overview Here you can find information about the requirements for the Computer Science degree Overview School of Engineering Requirements Math Science Engineering Fundamentals Technology in Society CS Department Requirements Core Track Electives Senior Project Writing in the Major Deviations and Petitions Signatures Overview The CS curriculum provides knowledge that is applicable across many fields including many areas of engineering science and medicine The core material of the computer science program has been streamlined into six classes that every CS student takes Students then pick an area that they would like to study in more depth which becomes their track specialization The track typically consists of 4 5 classes Finally students round out their CS curriculum with 2 4 elective courses The electives can be classes from different areas in CS if a student desires more breadth or they can be additional classes related to the student s track if a student desires more depth The track related electives also include courses outside of the CS department for students whose interests cross departmental boundaries and who would like to do interdisciplinary work For more details about specific classes check out course ranking sites Carta old class webpages and official course evaluations Course ranking sites have student comments and some official registrar data about course difficulty and instructor quality Class webpages from previous quarters will often contain handouts and old assignments that can give you a good feel for the class material Most CS classes are accessible via a stanford edu subdomain with the course number as the subdomain For example the CS107 page can be found at cs107 stanford edu You can find official course evaluations on Axess under Student Course and Section Evaluations When planning a course load it is a good idea to take into account not only the difficulty of a class but also the type of assignments Taking 3 classes that all have programming assignments and a large final project is probably not the best idea Typically a balanced schedule includes some mix of programming classes and problem set classes More tips are available on the courseload webpage The information on this page is kept up to date as much as possible but it is always a good idea to verify that it matches the undergraduate engineering handbook or your specific program sheet since they are the definitive sources of information on these matters School of Engineering Requirements These requirements are set and approved by the School of Engineering Changes to these requirements must be approved by the School of Engineering Office of Student Affairs in Huang 135 one quarter prior to a student s last quarter For most students this is winter quarter of senior year More instructions and forms are available at the UGHB petitions website Using AP Credit to satisfy math and science requirements must also be approved by the Office of Student Affairs To receive this approval take a program sheet and unofficial transcript to Huang 135 The math science and engineering fundamentals requirements for the biocomputation and computer engineering tracks differ from those listed here Please see the program sheets for specifics Math Calculus CS majors may use Math 19 20 21 41 42 or AP credit to satisfy the calculus requirement For more information refer to the Calculus sections of the Stanford AP Credit Chart Mathematics in Computer Science The undergradute curriculum requires two CS math classes Mathematical Foundations of Computing CS103 and Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists CS109 Math Electives Two additional math electives are required for the CS major The electives can be any combination of classes from an approved set of courses listed on the first page of the program sheets Because of significant overlap in the material covered certain class combinations cannot be counted towards the math requirement See your program sheet for more information Science Physics CS majors must take both a Mechanics class PHYSICS21 PHYSICS41 PHYSICS61 and an Electricity and Magnetism class PHYSICS23 PHYSICS43 PHYSICS63 Mixing classes from different series is acceptable Physics labs are not required for the CS major In general almost any college level first year physics class that covers mechanics and E M will be awarded transfer credit and count towards the physics requirement So if you want to take physics at Foothill College the local community college or at home over the summer that is usually fine The School of Engineering approves this requirement so it might be wise to check with them ahead of time if you re planning to do this AP credit will also satisfy the physics requirement For more information refer to the Physics sections of the Stanford AP Credit Chart Science Elective The science elective is one or perhaps two classes to bring the total science units to at least 11 The list of approved electives includes the School of Engineering science electives list plus PSYCH30 Perception A 5 on the AP Chemistry exam will count as 4 units of science elective credit This year s Undergraduate Engineering Handbook will also have an up to date list of classes that can be counted towards the science elective Engineering Fundamentals Programming Abstractions CS106B or CS106X CS106X covers the same topics as CS106B but with more in depth coverage and at a faster pace Note that it is also possible to take CS106X rather than CS106B after taking CS106A It is also strongly recommended that you take CS106X even if you ve had a considerable amount of prior programming experience particularly if you do not know C This will ensure you have the necessary foundation for more advanced work expected in later CS classes Introductory Electronics ENGR40 ENGR40 is an introductory electronics class taught by the EE department The class has weekly problem sets labs a midterm and a final Engineering Fundamentals Elective The engineering fundamentals elective is another class from the School of Engineering engineering fundamentals list This year s Undergraduate Engineering Handbook will also have an up to date list of classes that can be counted towards the engineering fundamentals elective Effective as of the 2017 2018 program sheets you can now count an additional CS depth course track or general elective in place of the second engineering fundamentals course Keep in mind that if you take ENGR40A instead of ENGR40M you still have to fulfill the required number of units within the Engineering Fundamentals section This can be done either by taking 5 unit Engineering Fundamentals Elective or making up the rest of the units in your depth courses For example if you take CS106B ENGR40A and a 3 unit Engineering Fundamentals you need another additional 2 units which you can make up by making sure you have 2 additional units in your depth courses on the back of the program sheet Technology in Society The TIS classes are devoted to exploring issues arising from the interplay of engineering technology and society Any class from the School of Engineering technology in society courses list can be counted towards this requirement This year s Undergraduate Engineering Handbook will also have an up to date list of classes that can be counted towards the technology in society requirement Computer Science Department Requirements Core Systems Programming Abstractions CS106B or CS106X CS106B introduces students to many fundamental programming concepts and software engineering techniques using the C language The course will focus on teaching problem solving skills basic abstract data typs and recursion General topics include basic programming methodology engineering modularity documentation data abstractions stacks queues linked lists hash tables binary trees generics and templates recursion procedural backtracking searching and sorting and basic algorithmic analysis including Big Oh notation Computer Organization and Systems CS107 CS107 transitions students to programming on the UNIX machines The class aims to teach students about computer systems from the hardware up to the source code Topics include machine architecture registers I O basic assembly language memory models pointers memory allocation data representation compilation stack frames semantic analysis code generation and basic concurrency threading synchronization Principles of Computer Systems CS110 CS110 will teach students how to build larger scale systems using operating system and networking abstractions Topics include processes threading context switching interprocess communication storage and file management file systems virtual memory networking sockets TCP IP routing and an understanding of distributed systems Theory Mathematical Foundations of Computing CS103 CS103 will give students the mathematical foundations necessary for computer science Topics include proof techniques and logic induction sets functions and relations an introduction to formal languages DFA s NFA s and Regular Expressions Context Free Grammars Turing Machines and NP Completeness Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists CS109 CS109 is designed to teach students material from probability and statistics that is relevant to computer science Topics include combinatorics probability theory conditional probability and independence probability distributions Bayes Theorem Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem and hypothesis testing The class will also cover applications of probability including hashing data analysis inference and an introduction to machine learning Data Structures and Algorithms CS161 CS161 gives students the tools to analyze data structures and algorithms Students will also practice devising algorithms for various problems These skills are widely applicable and alumni report CS161 as one of the most useful classes at Stanford Topics include algorithmic complexity analysis Big Oh Omega Theta recurrence relations and the master method In addition students learn about several different classes of algorithms and data structures including randomized algorithms divide and conquer strategies greedy algorithms hasing heaps graph algorithms and search algorithms including blind and A search Track The tracks allow students to develop depth in a particular specialization by taking 4 5 courses in a related area Students must complete the requirements for any one track which typically includes 1 2 gateway classes 1 2 classes form a menu of highly related courses and then a selection of classes from a list of more broadly related courses The current tracks are Artificial Intelligence Theory Systems Human Computer Interaction Graphics Information Biocomputation Unspecialized and Individually Designed For details about individual tracks and advice for choosing a track see the tracks page For more details about the specific academic requirements for each track please refer to the relevant program sheet Electives Some people use the electives to explore a broader array of topics in CS by taking additional introductory classes in different areas Others use them to pursue a particular topic in more depth by taking some of the higher level graduate classes This provides students additional flexibility to build a broader base of knowledge in CS or related areas or focus on a more specific topic For students doing research professors or advisors will be able to recommend relevant classes that can be used as electives The elective requirements can be fulfilled by taking classes from either of two lists the general CS electives list or the list of classes that fulfill the elective requirements specific to each track These track specific electives often include classes outside the CS department to allow for interdisciplinary work Check out a program sheet for the full list of available classes If you think a class should be on the list of approved general CS electives or a track specific electives list check out the Petitions section Senior Project Writing In the Major There are several options available for completing the senior project requirement The senior project class CS194 is the most common way In this class students work in teams to build a significant programming application learning and practicing useful strategies for software design and engineering At the end of the class students demo their projects in front of the other students course staff and representatives from many local companies CS294 fulfills the WIM requirement A second popular way to fulfill the senior project requirement is to take CS210 Project Experience with Corporate Partners This is a two quarter sequence where students work on loosely defined challenges defined by corporate partners R D labs Each team functions as a small startup company with dedicated space a discretionary budget and a technical advisory board comprised of the instructional staff The two quarter sequence affords time to experiment benchmark and try out different ideas before zeroing in on a particular direction The two quarter time frame also means provides enough time to build something of lasting impact This is class is also a great opportunity to develop relationships with a company and learn skills that are helpful for managing a team or starting a company Another option for senior project is to undertake individual research with a faculty member under the auspices of CS191 or CS191W CS191W is the writing intensive version that involves several writing assignments and fulfills the WIM requirement Doing a research based senior project can provide additional valuable experience for students interested in a research career Taking CS191 requires finding a faculty member who will oversee the project See the research page for more information on how to do this Students taking CS191 must also fill out a senior project proposal form and get the approvoal of their advisor and Patrick Young Another research based option to fulfill the senior project requirement is to do a senior honors thesis Writing an honors thesis includes a year long research project supervised by a CS faculty member Applications for the honors program are due by May 1 For more information see the Honors Page A final option for the senior project is CS294 the directed research classes If you d like to take part in active research but don t have a specific project in mind or would like some guidance CS294 might be for you The class is typically focused on a single large project of the professor s interest People choose or are assigned parts of the larger project to work on for the quarter For example in the past CS294 students contributed to the award winning DARPA Grand Challenge robot The topics for CS294 change each year though it s frequently been led by an AI professor Professors may expect students to be comfortable with techniques used in the field For example an AI CS294 might expect you to have taken CS221 Like CS191 students can opt to do a writing intensive version CS294W that fulfills the WIM requirement Almost everyone fulfills the WIM requirement when they do their senior project If you took CS201 for your TIS requirement then you do not need to fulfill WIM with senior project WIM is the only requirement that can be fulfilled by a class that also fulfills another requirement See the senior project page for more details Transfer Credit In order to receive transfer credit for anything on the front of the program sheet you must go through the School of Engineering Anything on the back of the program sheet requires approval of the CS Department To request an approval send an email to Jerry Cain jerry cs and CC it to Meredith Hutchin hutchin cs Include the Stanford class for

its reputation as one of the top CS programs in large part from this Your time at Stanford offers a unique opportunity to be involved in cutting edge research What is the difference between CURIS academic year research and honors thesis research CURIS CURIS is the program for undergraduate summer research in Computer Science Each summer some professors take undergraduates to work on their projects Participating students are expected to work on these projects full time and will be paid a stipend to cover living expenses The CURIS site has a list of the projects available that is usually updated sometime near the end of January with new projects for the upcoming summer The application deadline for CURIS is mid winter quarter Academic Year Research Students can also opt to participate in research during the academic year This is typically done for course credit More information on finding a project and what class to enroll in can be found in the answers to the subsequent questions Honors Thesis The Honors Thesis is a one year research project for students in their senior year During their Junior year students decide on a topic find a faculty sponsor and apply to the program During their senior year students take 3 units per quarter as independent study units and at the end of the year they write a thesis Most students who choose to write an honors thesis have research experience prior to the start of their honors project More information is available at the Honors website How can I learn about available research opportunities There many different ways to find out about research projects at Stanford Some examples are listed below Undergraduate CS Research Website The most reliable way to learn about projects you can get involved in it through the Undergraduate CS Research website Throughout the year professors have openings for undergrads to do work in their labs They post descriptions of these projects on the site for your perusal This site lists CS research project during the academic year for course credit CS research projects for the summer quarter under CURIS paid internship and research projects in other departments that include applications of CS Go to Office Hours Find a professor whose research interests you want to learn more about Discuss what possibilities are available or just find out more about what a particular group is doing Often the professor will be able to direct you to some research papers that might be valuable to read or some other groups that you might find interesting It s always a good idea to email a professor and let him or her know that you will be coming in That way if their office hours are particularly busy they can suggest another time Talk to a Grad Student Because the graduate students work on the projects every day and deal with most of the details they are probably one of the best sources of information They will have a good idea for what role you could initially play in the project and will also be able to give an honest assessment of what it is like to work with the professor and what are the expectations of the group Finally if you decide to work with the group the graduate students will probably be the ones that will be mentoring you in the day to day aspects of your work Before you choose a project try to meet with at least one graduate student in the group preferably one that would be mentoring you If you are still deciding between projects ask the graduate students what they think you d be surprised at how helpful and honest they can be Read Your Email The BSCS list is constantly getting announcements about presentations that are being given by faculty advanced graduate students and visiting faculty Take the time to read through some of the abstracts and pick a few that interest you Note that these announcements are not usually forwarded to the considering cs list If you are interested in getting these announcements come visit the Course Advisor and declare CS Attend Seminars and Presentations In addition to the talks and presentations that are announced by email there are some CS seminar series that are especially appropriate for learning about research Some of these are available as a 1 unit class or you can also just come in and hear the speakers that interest you CS 300 At the beginning of each academic year all new PhD students are required to take CS 300 In each seminarEach day two professors come in and describe their research work The idea is to give PhD students an overview of the ongoing research so they can decide which groups they would like to join Although the class is technically for PhD students undergraduate and masters students can enroll The presentations are likely to be somewhat technical but since they are geared towards PhD students with a broad variety of interests they should be fairly accessible You can also find the speaker schedule online 500 Level Seminars All of the CS 500 level courses are topic seminars For instance CS 547 is a seminar on Human Computer Interaction topics Each week a different speaker comes in and presents their research Sometimes the speakers are Stanford professors sometimes they re graduate students and sometimes they re outside visitors The presentations are often quite technical but if you check the schedules on the class webpages you should be able to find some talks that interest you CURIS Poster Session At the end of the summer quarter and the beginning of the fall quarter the CURIS program organizes poster sessions for undergraduates to present their summer research projects This is a great opportunity for you to get first hand information about your peers research experience as well as potential project ideas and research groups of interest In addition the display in the Gates lobby shows a collection of both undergraduate and graduate research projects year round What classes do I sign up for if I m doing research Undergraduate research is often done through CURIS for academic credit or through an informal arrangement with a professor Independent Study Research Classes 191 191W 195 199 399 CS 191 is a one quarter research project that fulfills the Senior Project requirement 191W is the Writing in the Major version of this course Students must set up their own project find a faculty sponsor and submit a proposal More information is available at the Senior Project website CS 195 is a one quarter research project that fulfills a CS elective on the undergraduate program sheet up to 4 units for students who are not yet eligible to take CS 191 Students must work under faculty supervision and get prior approval for their project CS 199 undergrad and CS 399 masters are one quarter independent studies for students who have already taken 4 units of CS 195 but are not eligible for CS 191 These units will count towards the university wide graduation requirements but not toward the CS major itself For all of these classes students can propose a project of their own or can find and receive approval for a project listed on the Undergraduate CS Research website All students must get prior approval from their faculty sponsor at the very least before signing up from any of these classes Research Project Course 294 294W Students can also opt for CS 294 or 294W the WIM version of the course which fulfills the senior project requirement and allows students to get involved in a major ongoing research project Check the course listing to see which research areas are covered in 294 for any given year Research Course Flowchart Still not sure what course is right for you That s alright Take a look at this flow chart Why should I do research If you might be interested in getting a PhD research experience is almost a prerequisite for admission to the top graduate programs and if you think you might like to be a professor or researcher someday you should absolutely make undergraduate research a top priority If you re not yet sure about your post graduation plans doing research as an undergraduate might help you decide if you are interested in continuing on to graduate school and working in academia Even if you aren t planning to go to graduate school participating in research can make you much more employable The most sought after students tend to be the ones with significant experience regardless of whether the research is directly applicable to the job Pursuing a research project requires you to be extremely self reliant and self motivated attributes that employers value highly If you think you might want to write an undergraduate honors thesis you will need to complete a research project Most students who write a thesis will have engaged in research prior to senior year and these prior experiences ultimately help them succeed in completing a thesis Finally doing individual research is challenging in ways classes are not Because they have been involved in research worked hard and learned these valuable skills students who have been involved in research tend to be at the top of their graduating classes What background do I need to start doing research The background that different groups require varies wildly Certain groups will require you to have advanced programming skills a strong math background or basic knowledge of the research area Other groups will have ways for students to get involved and contribute even if they haven t taken many CS courses yet For instance some groups are happy to take on frosh because they have many years ahead of them at Stanford and have lots of time to learn and do great work There are plenty of opportunities to contribute to a research project before your senior year so don t wait until you ve finished half the major to get involved Since the prerequisites for starting work on a research project vary widely among research areas and professors talk to a professor to get their advice Many professors teach an introductory class centering broadly on their research area and if you contact them will ask you to take that class If you get this response from a professor the best way to get into his or her research group is to take and ace this class If you re not sure yet whether you re interested in a particular topic the intro class would also be a good place for you to find out more about it In any case professors criteria for taking on students vary widely and if you are interested in working with a particular professor find out what classes to take or what to do in order to be considered for their research group You can email the professor or visit their office hours to ask It s best to do this as soon as possible because they ll often be able to give advice on courses to take that you haven t thought of and if you miss a course or its prerequisites you may have to wait a whole year to take it Do I need to have a specific project in mind No Most students start on research without having a particular project in mind Most professors supervise one or more research groups which typically consist of the professor s PhD students MS students and often a few undergraduate students Each group usually works on a significant project or idea with each student working on a key piece of it If you don t have a particular project in mind one of the best ways to get involved with research is to join one of these groups You ll probably spend some time helping with generic tasks and learning about the project Don t underestimate the value of this opportunity you ll get an inside look at how research is done and learn a lot about jumping into a large project something you ll have to do at almost any job you have after graduation After you spend some time with the group you or the professor will probably start to find particular aspects of the project that you can work on At this point you can discuss with your professor the best way to proceed with taking on more responsibility for a part of the project What should you do if you already have your own idea for a project In some cases students have a particular project or idea that they want to pursue so they find a professor with similar research interests and ask him or her to be the advisor for the project The professor provides guidance and suggestions while the student does the detailed research and experiments Getting started in research this way is less common and usually works only for students who are fairly far into the major or who have already had significant work experience in their field of interest but it is still possible How can I make my research experience a good one Many undergraduates who do research will consider it to be one of their best experiences at Stanford Although nothing can guarantee that your experience will be a good one here are a few tried and true tips for making your research experience enjoyable and rewarding Clearly define your expectations for the project Before you start working on any sort of research project make sure you ve sat down with the professor or the graduate student who will be supervising you and discussed exactly what you will be working on Every year at least one person has all sorts of complaints because they spent their whole summer working on a CURIS project they felt was drastically above or below their ability The professor has no way of knowing what you are willing and able to do if you don t communicate with them Before you take on a project make sure you understand what sort of day to day work is involved and that you are excited and happy about the opportunity You should also know who will be supervising you on a day to day basis and who you can turn to for advice and guidance if you run into problems Define how much time you can devote to research Nothing is worse than a flaky member of a group project As an undergraduate you have many commitments outside research It s therefore important to sit down with your professor or grad student supervisor and define exactly how much time you have available for the project and when you will be around If you know that you will be working on a class project 24 7 during dead week be sure to communicate that to your group and make sure that it s acceptable for you to be gone during that time Nothing is more frustrating to a research group than students who don t show up in lab and don t respond to emails Disappearing with your part of the project can delay others work Remember that research is the primary focus of PhD students and they will not be happy waiting around for you to get back to them and finish your work If this happens you will likely find yourself never assigned anything important again If however you ve outlined when you will be gone your group can plan around it and people won t be frustrated and disappointed when you disappear to finish that big project or study for finals Set specific hours when you will be at the lab working on your research This makes it easy for people to find you when they need to talk about work You will also be perceived as a reliable hard worker rather than someone who is sometimes around sometimes not depends how busy she is Many people who do research during the school year find that it keeps getting pushed off because everything else has a deadline By scheduling time to put into your research and sticking to it you ll avoid this situation and be less likely to disappoint yourself and your research group Take on the appropriate amount of work It is always better to do a great job on a small project than to do a bad job on a huge project Many graduate students are more experienced and have much more time to devote to research so they may expect you to be able to accomplish more than you have time to do Make sure your part of the project is something you can manage and make sure to deliver on any promises you make to your professor or research group Communicate with your group and professor Professors and graduate students are not mind readers If you re unhappy about something or might not be able to make a deadline make sure to bring it up in a non confrontational way and try to do so early Problems are always easier to solve if they have just started than if you have been silently steaming about them for six weeks Also be sure to communicate about the things that are going well If you are really excited about a certain aspect of your work let someone know The next time something similar comes along they ll be much more likely to send it your way How do I approach a professor Professors are people who have decided that their research is really interesting and important The fact that you are considering doing research and might go on to follow in their footsteps is really exciting to them They are much happier to talk to individual students about their research than they are to grade your midterms Also keep in mind that professors are judged by the quality of the research done by their groups and whether their groups manage to produce great students If it s possible that you will be a productive and useful person in their group while learning lots of things that s incredibly exciting and helpful to them as well Professors also deal with endless requests from graduate students not to mention people who haven t even been admitted to Stanford to join their lab in return for funding The fact that someone wants to join their lab just to learn is a great feeling for them With few exceptions most professors will be happy to talk with undergraduates about doing research and will do their best to find some way for you to contribute That being said keep in mind that professors also tend to be some of the busiest people on the planet Be respectful of their time as well as their knowledge and you will get a much better response Before contacting a professor for the first time take thirty seconds to check if they have a FAQ on their homepage that answers your questions and before you go in take time to read about the projects in which you are interested Professors are much more likely to respond to emails that show clear interest to specific research projects in the group compared to a generic email with your resume Also be willing to let them direct you to information rather than explain it all in person instead of demanding a personal tour of the lab ask if they can suggest some good papers for you to read or if there is a particular graduate student you should talk to If you approach a professor respectfully and then follow through with what you agreed to take on almost all professors at Stanford will be delighted to have you participate in their research group Stanford

A syllabus containing Exam dates and times Expectations for students e g late policy attendance etc Grading criteria Calendar of lecture topics and assignment due dates these may be tentative Clearly defined means of communication e g email lists online forums Set expectations In any teamwork situation it s very important for each person to communicate and understand each other s expectations and define roles This is no less true in the relationship between professor and CA Some professors may expect the CA to do everything but lecture while some CA s may expect to only grade In fact as you CA you will come to see that there is far more to running a successful course than simply lecturing and grading The roles and responsibilities for such tasks should be negotiated and understood from the beginning Typical expectations are as follows What you can expect from a professor Lecturing Homework and exam design Office hours Everything a CA is not able to do within their time constraints What a professor can expect from you Grading homeworks and exams Solution sets Office hours 25 CA 2 hours per week 50 CA 4 hours per week Section leading depending on the course Other administrative needs

Policy Research Cluster Policy Server Hosting University Policies Xenon Student Account Policies Research ClustersSAIL Compute Cluster Services The Team Typical CA Duties Grading homeworks For most CAs this will be their most time consuming and least rewarding responsibility CAs should carefully streamline their grading process in order to maximize their availability for other more rewarding aspects of the job Consult the CA training materials or CA Mentors for many tips on efficient grading Electronic communication Monitoring email and other electronic communications newsgroups Piazza is another important part of the job Students should be directed to a single address and any content related questions and answers should be made available to the entire class Instructors should take turns answering questions Holding office hours Successful office hours come to those who are prepared Be sure to review the assignments beforehand and give some thought to what hints are appropriate so that you will not accidentally give away too much It is also incredibly helpful to attend class whenever possible as you will be aware of which topics may need review Assisting with the creation of exams and homework Depending on the professor you may be asked to help write questions for the homeworks or exams Rely on your experiences in office hours and remember to get feedback from the rest of the course staff in order to make questions as clear as possible For large classes you may wish to schedule make up exams before the scheduled exam in order to gather feedback on which questions need revising However primary responsibility for designing homeworks and exams should always rest with the professor see Common Pitfalls below Maintaining grades The CAs will maintain the list of grades and there are various ways to do it We recommend using a simple spreadsheet accessible by the entire grading staff This should be handled with extreme care both in terms of correctness and privacy and should be backed up regularly Giving feedback to the instructor Don t hesitate to let the professor know what is going well with the course as well as what could be improved CAs typically enjoy more face to face contact with students than the instructor does and can see from grading homeworks how students are doing Students also often feel more comfortable addressing their criticisms and concerns to the CAs these should always be diplomatically passed along to the instructor Administering and grading exams The midterm and final if any are graded by the CAs and the instructor together It is customary for the instructor to provide food during the session Contact Claire Stager with any questions on ordering food for exam grading sessions Before the Quarter Begins up Managing Your Time

Policy Research Cluster Policy Server Hosting University Policies Xenon Student Account Policies Research ClustersSAIL Compute Cluster Services The Team Managing Your Time Set Boundaries As a CA it s important to find tactful ways to set boundaries A 50 CA is expected to work an average of 20 hours week and a 25 CA is expected to work an average of 10 hours week We stress average because the workload will vary significantly over the course of the quarter For example there s usually a considerable start up cost before and into the first week of the quarter a brief lull before the first homeworks are turned in and then a more average stream of work until the end of the quarter crunch A couple weeks into the quarter is usually a good time to judge whether the amount of work you re expected to do is reasonable If after cutting every corner in your time management you re unable to do the work expected of you in the average time you re committed to it s time to communicate reasonable expectations Properly allocating one s time and energy among each life s priorities research family CAship etc is immensely valuable and requires consistent vigilance and self reflection Keep in mind that the professor should be expected to respect reasonable boundaries that guard priorities to other commitments For you the CA expressing care for the quality of the course compassion for the professor and a firm resolve to balance your various commitments demonstrates maturity and professionalism Be Efficient Graduate students and CAs in particular often face many competing priorities and finding your own balance is an important part of being a good CA Here are some ways that you can make the most out of your limited time Cutting Corners These are examples of corner cutting that can save unnecessary time and effort without significant negative impact on course quality Don t spend time typesetting Aesthetic concerns are noble but time consuming Exceptions apply if you are faster typesetting than handwriting Avoid writing long emails Oftentimes conceptual problems can be worked through more efficiently in office hours or on the phone Don t hesitate to reply by asking the student to come to office hours Avoid overly detailed grading You want to maximize the help to the student while minimizing time effort burnout all while applying the grading criteria fairly Concentrate on the major difficulties and devote more time to developing clear solution sets or grading rubrics which will benefit all students Drop unnecessary tasks Do the students need a newsgroup Should there be a strict limit to when and how much e mail you respond to Does a homework figure need to be perfectly done in a graphic editor or can it be drawn by hand and photocopied Drawing Lines If you re still overwhelmed by the average weekly work after doing your very best to use your time efficiently you then need to find a way to offload or share responsibilities In addition you need to do it in such a way that is humble honest and firm about your limitations yet leaves the faculty member assured that you care about the course and are doing your very best to fulfill all of your commitments with integrity and excellence This can be difficult especially when teaching with your research advisor Have your professor prioritize your tasks Then you will both understand the tasks at hand and it should become apparent if there is too much on your plate Give reasonable time estimates for each task and when the professor can expect each to be done Then follow through Volunteer for specific duties Being positive I can do reinforces which responsibilities you ve taken on and which you have not It also sends the important message that you are eager to assist within reasonable limits Avoid counting minutes but watch your hours closely If a course is insufficiently staffed it is the responsibility of the instructor and department to hire additional CAs Most faculty are reasonable and respectful If they understand that you care about their course but have other commitments you need to keep they will usually help you find ways to manage your time for the maximum benefit of the class If after doing everything to be efficient communicating your commitment to the course and drawing lines as tactfully as possible you still find yourself in a bad working relationship seek counsel from Claire Stager or the University Ombudsman as a last resort Your time is precious Typical CA Duties up Teaching Support Academics CS Commencement Course Assistants CAs

course is entitled to several online resources including a website mailing lists disk space and URL redirection to name a few All these resources may be requested on the IT Services website at https itservices stanford edu service its course support Typically it is the instructor s responsibility to complete these requests not the CA s Course website Putting handouts on your course s website can be a convenient way for students to have access to course resources in one place It is important to remember however that by default your course website will be visible to the world So don t publish anything on the website that you don t want the world to see For example solution sets should rarely if ever be posted on a course website since this forces instructors of your course in the future as well as courses at other schools to use different problems that aren t solvable via Google Additionally protected publications for example a journal paper obtained from the publisher s website should not be made publicly available on your course website However this should not prevent you from posting these kinds of materials if need be Some or all of your course website can be protected behind Stanford s WebAuth service see here for instructions By protecting your course website with WebAuth only people with SUNet IDs students faculty staff etc will be able to access your website You can even fine tune the WebAuth settings for your site so that for example only students enrolled in your course can view the site On your web page spend some time at the beginning of the quarter to find a few links on the web relevant to your subject that will allow interested students to get more food for thought Examples of useful links include Classes offered in similar subjects Applications of the topic Cool demos great Reference manuals for whatever software language library environment OS you are using Don t put the course description on the top of your web page The goal of the web page is to be useful primarily to students who are taking the class not as an advertisement to the outside world You can always link to a separate page containing that sort of information Mailing Lists Classes are setup with several mailing lists as detailed here By default courses will have multiple mailing lists for the students for the staff etc Stanford Coursework Stanford Coursework is Stanford University s learning management system It is used primarily by instructors to create course web sites and manage content Course sites have several useful features including roster management and

Send us the question and we will do our best to find an answer If you have the answer let us know too so that we can improve this faq list Why am I still being charged tuition The CS department hires over 150 CAs each quarter and it takes some time to enter everyone s appointments into the system You probably won t see your tuition credit appear on your bill until the first or second week of class When do I get paid For the 2018 19 school year paydates are as follows Autumn Quarter Paydates October 22 November 7 November 22 December 7 December 22 January 7 Winter Quarter Paydates January 22 February 7 February 22 March 7 March 22 April 7 Spring Quarter Paydates April 22 May 7 May 22 June 7 June 22 July 7 Summer Quarter Paydates July 22 August 7 August 22 September 7 Where can I borrow textbooks for my course There is a small library of CS textbooks located in Claire Stager s office Gates 182 which are available for borrowing by TAs Texts are to be returned at the end of the quarter Make sure to borrow the textbook for the class if you don t have it If it is not in the library the department will probably buy a copy for you Should I attend classes It is up to the instructor to decide whether you should attend the classes or not If you attend classes you will be better in sync with the class you will be able to develop your own perspective on the material Last but not least the time after class is perfect to meet the students and let them know that you exist They might even be lured into coming to your office hours When should I set my office hours If the class is offered to SCPD students one CA should have an office hour sometime after 6pm so that SCPD students can come by after work Whether we like it or not students tend to do their homework at the last minute If you set an office hour the day before the homework is due around 4pm chances are that you will have a very busy time Another opinion Setting office hours right before due date is convenient for those who procrastinate However it also encourages procrastination There are a couple good reasons for having office hours a little in advance of due dates It doesn t reward procrastination Why shouldn t part of education be about discipline and time management It recognizes the fact that assignments aren t always flawless If people need to start looking at the homework well in advance of the due date in order to see what questions they might have for office hours this provides time for the CAs to correct or disambiguate the assignment and reduces everyone s stress level Every try doing damage control on a flawed assignment at the last moment Should I prepare homeworks A teaching assistant should not prepare homeworks except in exceptional cases A homework has to be very well thought out to be in synchronization with the class and it is also extremely hard and lengthy to design good homeworks Bad homeworks make students bored with the material and don t make them learn anything If the instructor asks you whether you would like to design the homeworks think very carefully about it and whether you are up to the job In all cases you should not feel obliged to accept as this is an integral part of the normal instructor work It is better not to take this responsibility but to give occasional ideas for good homework questions Should I prepare solutions Yes if the instructor doesn t have them already It is a good idea to prepare solutions in the light of the errors you saw the most often made while grading At the end of a solution you may list typical mistakes and the reason why these are mistakes so that students learn by the mistakes made by others you will at the same time reduce the number of requests for regradings How to use the copy machine You should ask Mindy Chang mchang15 stanford edu for the copy code that is to be used for the class This code works on all copy machines in the Gates building For big copy jobs it is recommended to use the fastest machine Gates 169 For help with the copy machine see Mindy Chang Gates 191 or Hector Gamez Gates B18 If you notice we re running low on paper please tell Hector Gamez Gates B18 Can we get one more CA for the class There is a standard formula for computing the number of CAs assigned to a class see the TA assignment policy Make sure that you have the alloted number of CAs for your class Often it is necessary to wait until the first homework is turned in to get an exact count of the number of students in the class before requesting an additional CA The Stanford Honor Code up

Professor Hector Garcia Molina November 2019A gifted scholar dedicated teacher and caring colleague Hector Garcia Molina a professor of computer science and of electrical engineering who pioneered some of the database technologies that underlie modern cloud computing died of cancer on Nov 25 on the eve of his 66th birthday He will be sorely missed said Stanford Provost Persis Drell who became acquainted with Garcia Molina while she served as dean of Stanford s School of Engineering Jennifer Widom who is currently dean of the school and had long standing research collaborations with Garcia Molina received an outpouring of messages extolling the humility and wisdom that made him a sought after mentor His door was always open and he welcomed everyone with a smile Widom said Hector served as a mentor to me from the time I arrived as an assistant professor through succeeding him as chair of the computer science department to when I became dean A native of Monterrey Mexico Garcia Molina came to Stanford in 1975 to study electrical engineering and computer science and in 1976 began his PhD studies under the guidance of Gio Wiederhold now a professor emeritus of computer science Wiederhold recalls the fearless but shrewd way that Garcia Molina waded into a new area of research soon known as distributed databases Today when we place an order online we take for granted that warehouses shipping facilities banks and other facilities will jointly carry out whatever operations might be needed to complete the transaction But 40 years ago the distributed databases that help orchestrate such disparate tasks did not exist Wiederhold said Garcia Molina understood that he needed to establish the legitimacy of his research by publishing a series of papers outlining not only how this technology would work but also how it would be applied in practice On the personal side Wiederhold recalls the time a tree fell on his house and in another instance when a visitor s car slid off the road how Garcia Molina organized volunteers to help Hector would see what had to be done and do it Wiederhold said After earning his PhD in 1979 Garcia Molina joined the faculty at Princeton where he helped develop the foundations for a technology called RAID short for Redundant Array of Independent Disks which improved database performance by keeping copies of data in locations closer to users while minimizing data losses by providing backups should one disk crash Jeffrey Ullman now a professor emeritus of computer science at Stanford was on the Princeton faculty in 1979 when Garcia Molina assumed his post there Many years later after Ullman moved to Stanford and later became chair of the Department of Computer Science he helped bring Garcia Molina back to campus Garcia Molina joined the Stanford faculty in 1992 and in 1995 was named the Leonard Bosack and Sandy K Lerner Professor in Engineering I had the pleasure of recruiting Hector twice said Ullman Ullman s long association with Garcia Molina gave him a special appreciation for the latter s research philosophy He believed in finding simple and efficient solutions that got 90 percent of the way toward the best possible in preference to more complicated expensive solutions that might be a little better in rare cases Ullman said As a result of this philosophy many of Garcia Molina s papers broke open new fields and were highly cited He has a remarkable 37 papers with 500 or more citations In the mid 1990s Garcia Molina together with now emeritus professor Terry Winograd launched the Stanford Digital Libraries Project a 10 year effort to develop ways to capture store and filter the many types of information held in traditional libraries Early student researchers on that project included Sergey Brin and Larry Page who co founded Google Garcia Molina advised 57 PhD students during his 40 year academic career He edited authored or co authored nine books and published more than 400 journal articles and refereed conference papers In 2001 Garcia Molina was invited to join the board of directors of Oracle Corporation a position he held until his death He forged personal and professional bonds with many leaders of the database company including founder and chairman Larry Ellison who offered this statement We will all miss his contributions I will miss Hector s pleasant and persuasive way of discussing complex ideas Hector s gentle and considerate personal style captured my enduring respect and affection Garcia Molina who served as chair of the Stanford Department of Computer Science from 2001 through 2004 was the recipient of numerous awards and was recognized by many professional bodies including the Association for Computing Machinery the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering Hector was a rare academic leader and mentor who had no ego getting in the way said Andreas Paepcke a senior research engineer who worked closely with Garcia Molina for many years He was consistently sharing credit yielding high profile podiums to those who worked with him Garcia Molina was widely known and admired for his professional level photographic skills which he shared freely in many ways He frequently opened his home to create studio quality portraits for Stanford colleagues and he was an official Stanford sports photographer capturing student athletes at football games and other sporting events with notable favorites being lacrosse field hockey soccer rugby swimming and water polo Perhaps his most far reaching impact as a serious photographer was his long running course CS45N a freshman introductory seminar on the topic of computers and photography Tiffany Ong a senior in computer science who took CS45N in her first year recalled how Garcia Molina loaned students digital cameras and organized photographic expeditions to the San Francisco Zoo and Half Moon Bay or simply led them through the Stanford Quad at night When Ong became his teaching assistant in the current offering of CS45N she experienced Garcia Molina s dedication to teaching on a deeper level as he worked with his teaching assistants to keep the class on track despite his illness Because of him hundreds of students over the years have gained the confidence to become photographers and artists on their own despite never having touched a camera before the class Ong said Garcia Molina is survived by his loving family The last moments he spent with his son were joyful reminiscing with old photos after a walk in the California sun BY TOM ABATE

Research Cluster Policy Server Hosting University Policies Xenon Student Account Policies Research ClustersSAIL Compute Cluster Services The Team Professor John McCarthy October 2011The Department of Computer Science is saddened to report that Emeritus Professor John McCarthy died on October 24 2011 at age 84 John was one of the founders of artificial intelligence AI coining that name in 1955 From that time until his death he made foundational contributions both to AI and to computer science in general In a famous 1958 paper and subsequent memos he proposed and thereafter strongly held that the knowledge needed by AI programs should be represented in declarative sentences principally in a logical language rather than being encoded within the programs that use that knowledge As he put it Sentences can be true in much wider contexts than specific programs can be useful John s work on AI systems that could reason with declarative knowledge inspired a legion of researchers who along with John advanced this approach to AI and produced many practical applications of it Realizing some of the difficulties of getting logical systems to reason with commonsense knowledge John extended logic to be able to deal with contexts and with the use of default but not necessarily universally true knowledge In 1958 John invented the list processing language LISP which became the language of choice for programming AI systems Programs written in LISP have flown in a NASA spacecraft and are key parts of several practical AI systems John s 1960 paper Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine Part I established the theoretical foundations of LISP as a universal computational formalism John also made seminal contributions to the problem of proving that programs meet their specifications In a memo written on January 1 1959 John was the first to describe a way to do general purpose computer timesharing allowing a single computer to be simultaneously shared among a number of users and that inspired four groups in the MIT community to develop such systems That made possible the development of ARPAnet a few years later which started as a network of timesharing systems A few years after that it turned into the Internet which still depends on timesharing systems in its core It is not clear how long that all would have taken had John not started it in 1959 John grew up and went to school in Los Angeles He got his undergraduate degree at Caltech and his PhD at Princeton both in mathematics After brief professorships at Stanford 1953 1955 and at Dartmouth College 1955 1958 John went to MIT where he along with his colleague Marvin Minsky founded the MIT Artificial Intelligence Project In 1962 John came to the Mathematics Department at Stanford and then transferred to Stanford s newly formed Department of Computer Science in 1965 where he with the help of Lester Earnest founded and led the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory SAIL During the 1960s and 1970s SAIL was a shining example of what a community of very bright faculty students and staff could accomplish when provided with adequate funding powerful computers peripheral equipment such as display devices and printers and associated software Much of the equipment and software needed was developed at SAIL The foundations for graphical user interfaces and printers computer typesetting and publishing speech recognition expert systems computer vision and robotics computer music and other technologies that are now parts of our everyday lives all got their start at SAIL s facilities in the Stanford foothills John s accomplishments his many publications and his prescient insights earned him many awards Among these are the ACM Turing Award the National Medal of Science the Kyoto Prize and memberships in the National Academy of Science and the National Academy of Engineering John McCarthy s genius puckish humor and presence along with his provocations to think more deeply will be greatly missed by his colleagues and many friends Fortunately there is still much to be mined from his Web pages at http www formal stanford edu jmc by Nils J Nilsson Gates

professor emeritus of computer science and co founder of Stanford s Scientific Computing and Computational Mathematics Program died of cancer at his home in Truckee Calif He was 63 Oliger was born Sept 3 1941 in Greensburg Ind He received his bachelor s degree in mathematics in 1966 and his master s degree in 1971 both from the University of Colorado Between 1965 and 1973 he worked as a programmer and numerical analyst at the National Center for Atmospheric Research He received a doctorate in computer science from the University of Uppsala Sweden in 1973 Oliger joined the Stanford Computer Science Department in 1974 as an assistant professor teaching numerical analysis courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels He became a full professor in 1980 In 1987 Oliger co founded the Scientific Computing and Computational Mathematics Program with professors Gene Golub George Homsy and Joseph Keller Oliger was noted for his influential work on partial differential equations that arise in meteorological problems He was an active adviser and mentor for a number of graduate students In addition to his work in the Computer Science Department Oliger consulted with students and faculty in the departments of Mechanical Engineering and Geophysics Joe wrote many technical articles reports and books notably Time Dependent Problems and Difference Methods with his former thesis adviser Heinz Otto Kreiss and Bertil Gustafsson published in 1996 In addition to his academic pursuits Oliger enjoyed the outdoors and was an avid rockclimber and skier He loved the wilderness of the Sierra Nevadas where he made his home after retiring from Stanford in September 2001 A number of Oliger s graduate students went on to distinguished careers Joe s enthusiastic attitude was infectious and he had a big heart said Wei Pai Tang who received his doctorate in mathematics in 1987 under Oliger s mentorship The march leading to my Ph D was long and difficult and I am deeply indebted to him Former student Jim Lambers now a research associate in Stanford s Petroleum Engineering Department admired Oliger s ability to recognize potential new applications for existing ideas This readiness to examine old ideas in a new light set an example for me to follow he said Joe was creative and would devise computer solutions that would only later appear in the literature recalled Paul Swarztrauber a colleague of Oliger s at the National Center for Atmospheric Research He had enormous grit and seemed almost oblivious to adversity He was able to get to the heart of a problem Added Tang The most valuable lesson I learned from Professor Oliger is not to just follow where the path may lead but to go where there is no path I am proud to say that I am a

pioneer Robert W Floyd a professor emeritus and former chair of the Department of Computer Science died on Sept 25 after a long illness He was 65 In the old days programmers would just twiddle with programs till they seemed to work says Professor Emeritus of The Art of Computer Programming Donald Knuth Floyd showed that there was a way to prove programs would work His approach of marrying math with computer science was a revelation to the field Knuth says Floyd s 1960s method of invariants in which assertions are attached to points in a computer program is still the basis of much work in proving that computer programs meet their specifications says John McCarthy professor emeritus of computer science Born in New York on June 8 1936 Floyd was recognized as a child prodigy at age 6 he skipped three grades and finished high school at 14 A scholarship allowed him to study at the University of Chicago where he received a bachelor s degree in liberal arts in 1953 at age 17 After that he supported himself and earned another bachelor s degree in physics in 1958 Though he never went through the formalities of obtaining a doctorate prior to his appointment as an associate professor of computer science at Stanford in 1968 he had written at least a dozen papers considered superior to any doctoral dissertation in computer science at the time One of the hottest topics in computer science at the time was the language of computer programming Says Knuth There were only four good papers on the topic all by Floyd His research included design and analysis of algorithms for finding the shortest paths in a network parsing decomposing programming languages calculating quantiles printing shades of gray on a dot printer sorting information and selecting random permutations and combinations His most important scientific achievement however was pioneering systematic methods of program verification His seminal 1967 paper Assigning Meanings to Programs opened the field of program verification His basic idea was to attach so called tags in the form of logical assertions to individual program statements or branches that would define the effects of the program based on a formal semantic definition of the programming language Many researchers in formal methods of computing worldwide adopted this method One of the most important influences was on C A R Hoare who in 1969 starting from Floyd s work developed his calculus of pre and postcondition semantics for computer programs Early on Knuth and Floyd had found their academic exchanges so productive that they decided they had to be at the same institution and both came to Stanford The two were in constant communication when Knuth was working on his book The Art of Computer Programming originally intended to be one volume which was supposed to assemble all the interesting algorithms that computer science had to offer But Knuth was not able to finish his book As he was writing he constantly had to cope with new elegant algorithms that he needed to accommodate Floyd the book s major pre publication reviewer and the person cited more than anyone else in the book was the main culprit The Art of Computer Programming eventually was transformed into a series of seven volumes and is still a work in progress Floyd may have been the first advocate of refactoring the rewriting of working programs from scratch re using only the essential ideas Refactoring is now standard practice among computer programmers By continuously looking for simpler ways to do the same thing Floyd aimed to improve not only programs but also programmers abilities and understanding At Stanford he taught algorithmic courses including Sorting and Searching With his former graduate student Richard Beigel he wrote a textbook titled The Language of Machines An Introduction to Computability and Formal Languages Computer Science Press 1994 Floyd was chair of the Department of Computer Science from 1973 to 1975 a period of great departmental growth when Computer Science moved from Forsythe Hall to more centrally located Margaret Jacks Hall Floyd was able to use the prestige of his post in conjunction with Amnesty International and an international cadre of systems scientists to help save former Chilean Minister of Education Fernando Flores who was relegated by the Pinochet government to one of Chile s worst prison camps On the basis of an invitation to study at Stanford issued by Floyd Flores was allowed to leave the country with his family he eventually finished his studies at Berkeley and co authored a book with Stanford computer science Professor Terry Winograd In 1978 Floyd won the Association for Computing Machinery ACM Turing Award the highest honor in computer science for having a clear influence on methodologies for the creation of efficient and reliable software and for helping to found the following important subfields of computer science the theory of parsing the semantics of programming languages automatic program verification automatic program synthesis and analysis of algorithms In 1991 the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE Computer Society awarded Floyd its Computer Pioneer Award for his work on early compilers A compiler is software that translates a computer program as a whole into machine code that is saved for subsequent execution at a desired time Floyd who retired from Stanford in 1994 was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the ACM Dawn Levy Stanford

Arthur L Samuel died July 29 1990 at Stanford hospital from complications related to Parkinson s disease Arthur Samuel was a pioneer of artificial intelligence research His life spanned a broad personal and scientific history Arthur Samuel was born in Emporia Kansas in 1901 He graduated from M I T with a Master s of Science degree in Electrical Engineering in 1926 working intermittently at General Electric Co in Schenectady He later did graduate work in Physics at Columbia University His undergraduate school the College of Emporia awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1946 After his master s degree he stayed on at M I T as an instructor in Electrical Engineering until 1928 when he joined Bell Telephone Laboratories At Bell Labs he mainly worked on electron tubes Particularly notable was his work on space charge between parallel electrodes and his wartime work on TR boxes This is a switch that disconnects the receiver of a radar when the radar is transmitting and prevents the sensitive receiver from being destroyed by the high power transmitter In 1946 Samuel became Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Illinois and became active in their project to design one of the first electronic computers It was there he conceived the idea of a checker program that would beat the world champion and demonstrate the power of electronic computers Apparently the program was not finished while he was at the University of Illinois perhaps because the computer wasn t finished in time In 1949 Samuel joined IBM s Poughkeepsie Laboratory This move was seen by IBM s competitors as a commitment by IBM to vacuum tube based computing but as his autobiography describes it he had to fulfill a dual role there pushing research on switching transistors and keeping engineers going with the available tube technology Tubes were used for logic and memory in IBM s first stored program computer the 701 The memory was based on Williams tubes which stored bits as charged spots on the screen of a cathode ray tube Samuel managed to increase the number of bits stored from the customary 512 to 2048 and to raise the mean time to failure to half an hour Memory capacities of those machines eventually grew to 8K words He completed the first checker program on the 701 and when it was about to be demonstrated Thomas J Watson Sr the founder and President of IBM remarked that the demonstration would raise the price of IBM stock 15 points It did The Samuel Checkers playing Program appears to be the world s first self learning program and as such a very early demonstration of a fundamental concept of Artificial Intelligence AI Programs for playing games fill the role in AI research that the fruit fly Drosophila plays in genetics Drosophilae are convenient for genetics because they breed fast and are cheap to keep and games are convenient for AI because it is easy to compare computer performance with that of people Samuel took advantage of another fact about checkers for his learning research Namely the checker players have access to many volumes of annotated games with the good moves distinguished from the bad ones Samuel s learning program replayed the games presented in Lee s Guide to Checkers to adjust its criteria for choosing moves so that the program would choose those thought good by checker experts as often as possible In 1961 when Ed Feigenbaum and Julian Feldman were putting together the first AI anthology Computers and Thought they asked Samuel to give them as an appendix to his splendid paper on his checker player the best game the program had ever played Samuel used that request as an opportunity to challenge the Connecticut state checker champion the number four ranked player in the nation Samuel s program won The champion provided annotation and commentary to the game when it was included in the volume Because his checker work was one of the earliest examples of non numerical computation Samuel greatly influenced the instruction set of early IBM computers The logical instructions of these computers were put in at his instigation and were quickly adopted by all computer designers because they are useful for most non numerical computation Samuel was a modest man and the importance of his work was widely recognized only after his retirement from IBM in 1966 He did not relish the politics that would have been required to get his research more vigorously followed up He was also realistic about the large difference between what had been accomplished in understanding intellectual mechanisms and what will be required to reach human level intelligence Samuel s papers on machine learning are still worth studying With great creativity and working essentially alone doing his own programming he invented several seminal techniques in rote learning and generalization learning using such underlying techniques as mutable evaluation functions hill climbing and signature tables One still hears proposals for research in this area less sophisticated than his work of the 1950s Besides engineering and computer science Samuel did important management work at IBM He played a large role in establishing IBM s European laboratories and setting their research directions especially in Zurich This laboratory did important work in physics leading to several Nobel prizes He became the editor of the influential IBM Journal of Research and Development Samuel retired from IBM in 1966 and came to Stanford University as a Lecturer and Research Associate starting yet another second life In 1974 he became a research professor here He continued his work on checkers until his program was outclassed in the 1970s He also worked on speech recognition until the funding agency DARPA decided to concentrate its speech work on developing one single approach Arthur was actively teaching up to 1982 Arthur Samuel remained an active computer programmer long after age forced him to give up active research His contributions included work on the SAIL operating system on Software for the Livermore S 1 Multi processor and on the TEX typesetting system His last work continued up to the age of 86 involved modifying programs for printing in multiple type fonts on some of the Stanford Computer Science Department s computers We believe he was the world s oldest active computer programmer The Stanford computer he used tells us that he last logged into it on February 2 1990 One of Samuel s talents was understanding inadequate documentation of complicated programs and writing clear and attractive manuals His First Grade Tex was recently translated into Japanese Recently he started an autobiography which unfortunately takes us only to the middle sixties Arthur Samuel was a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers the American Physical Society the Institute of Radio Engineers the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and a member of the Association for Computing Machinery and the American Association for the Advancement of Science As a person Samuel was distinguished by his objectivity and his kindness in helping many people especially in learning about the many matters in which he was expert Gio Wiederhold John McCarthy Ed Feigenbaum Gates Computer Science Building 353 Jane Stanford Way Stanford CA 94305 Phone 650 723 2300 Admissions

https://cs.stanford.edu/degrees/undergrad/Requirements.shtml ##### Stanford University Undergraduate Major in Computer Science Home Declaring The Major Program Sheets The Minor The Coterm Petitions Transfer Credit Events Who To See Course and Requirement Overview Here you can find information about the requirements for the Computer Science degree Overview School of Engineering Requirements Math Science Engineering Fundamentals Technology in Society CS Department Requirements Core Track Electives Senior Project Writing in the Major Deviations and Petitions Signatures Overview The CS curriculum provides knowledge that is applicable across many fields including many areas of engineering science and medicine The core material of the computer science program has been streamlined into six classes that every CS student takes Students then pick an area that they would like to study in more depth which becomes their track specialization The track typically consists of 4 5 classes Finally students round out their CS curriculum with 2 4 elective courses The electives can be classes from different areas in CS if a student desires more breadth or they can be additional classes related to the student s track if a student desires more depth The track related electives also include courses outside of the CS department for students whose interests cross departmental boundaries and who would like to do interdisciplinary work For more details about specific classes check out course ranking sites Carta old class webpages and official course evaluations Course ranking sites have student comments and some official registrar data about course difficulty and instructor quality Class webpages from previous quarters will often contain handouts and old assignments that can give you a good feel for the class material Most CS classes are accessible via a stanford edu subdomain with the course number as the subdomain For example the CS107 page can be found at cs107 stanford edu You can find official course evaluations on Axess under Student Course and Section Evaluations When planning a course load it is a good idea to take into account not only the difficulty of a class but also the type of assignments Taking 3 classes that all have programming assignments and a large final project is probably not the best idea Typically a balanced schedule includes some mix of programming classes and problem set classes More tips are available on the courseload webpage The information on this page is kept up to date as much as possible but it is always a good idea to verify that it matches the undergraduate engineering handbook or your specific program sheet since they are the definitive sources of information on these matters School of Engineering Requirements These requirements are set and approved by the School of Engineering Changes to these requirements must be approved by the School of Engineering Office of Student Affairs in Huang 135 one quarter prior to a student s last quarter For most students this is winter quarter of senior year More instructions and forms are available at the UGHB petitions website Using AP Credit to satisfy math and science requirements must also be approved by the Office of Student Affairs To receive this approval take a program sheet and unofficial transcript to Huang 135 The math science and engineering fundamentals requirements for the biocomputation and computer engineering tracks differ from those listed here Please see the program sheets for specifics Math Calculus CS majors may use Math 19 20 21 41 42 or AP credit to satisfy the calculus requirement For more information refer to the Calculus sections of the Stanford AP Credit Chart Mathematics in Computer Science The undergradute curriculum requires two CS math classes Mathematical Foundations of Computing CS103 and Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists CS109 Math Electives Two additional math electives are required for the CS major The electives can be any combination of classes from an approved set of courses listed on the first page of the program sheets Because of significant overlap in the material covered certain class combinations cannot be counted towards the math requirement See your program sheet for more information Science Physics CS majors must take both a Mechanics class PHYSICS21 PHYSICS41 PHYSICS61 and an Electricity and Magnetism class PHYSICS23 PHYSICS43 PHYSICS63 Mixing classes from different series is acceptable Physics labs are not required for the CS major In general almost any college level first year physics class that covers mechanics and E M will be awarded transfer credit and count towards the physics requirement So if you want to take physics at Foothill College the local community college or at home over the summer that is usually fine The School of Engineering approves this requirement so it might be wise to check with them ahead of time if you re planning to do this AP credit will also satisfy the physics requirement For more information refer to the Physics sections of the Stanford AP Credit Chart Science Elective The science elective is one or perhaps two classes to bring the total science units to at least 11 The list of approved electives includes the School of Engineering science electives list plus PSYCH30 Perception A 5 on the AP Chemistry exam will count as 4 units of science elective credit This year s Undergraduate Engineering Handbook will also have an up to date list of classes that can be counted towards the science elective Engineering Fundamentals Programming Abstractions CS106B or CS106X CS106X covers the same topics as CS106B but with more in depth coverage and at a faster pace Note that it is also possible to take CS106X rather than CS106B after taking CS106A It is also strongly recommended that you take CS106X even if you ve had a considerable amount of prior programming experience particularly if you do not know C This will ensure you have the necessary foundation for more advanced work expected in later CS classes Introductory Electronics ENGR40 ENGR40 is an introductory electronics class taught by the EE department The class has weekly problem sets labs a midterm and a final Engineering Fundamentals Elective The engineering fundamentals elective is another class from the School of Engineering engineering fundamentals list This year s Undergraduate Engineering Handbook will also have an up to date list of classes that can be counted towards the engineering fundamentals elective Effective as of the 2017 2018 program sheets you can now count an additional CS depth course track or general elective in place of the second engineering fundamentals course Keep in mind that if you take ENGR40A instead of ENGR40M you still have to fulfill the required number of units within the Engineering Fundamentals section This can be done either by taking 5 unit Engineering Fundamentals Elective or making up the rest of the units in your depth courses For example if you take CS106B ENGR40A and a 3 unit Engineering Fundamentals you need another additional 2 units which you can make up by making sure you have 2 additional units in your depth courses on the back of the program sheet Technology in Society The TIS classes are devoted to exploring issues arising from the interplay of engineering technology and society Any class from the School of Engineering technology in society courses list can be counted towards this requirement This year s Undergraduate Engineering Handbook will also have an up to date list of classes that can be counted towards the technology in society requirement Computer Science Department Requirements Core Systems Programming Abstractions CS106B or CS106X CS106B introduces students to many fundamental programming concepts and software engineering techniques using the C language The course will focus on teaching problem solving skills basic abstract data typs and recursion General topics include basic programming methodology engineering modularity documentation data abstractions stacks queues linked lists hash tables binary trees generics and templates recursion procedural backtracking searching and sorting and basic algorithmic analysis including Big Oh notation Computer Organization and Systems CS107 CS107 transitions students to programming on the UNIX machines The class aims to teach students about computer systems from the hardware up to the source code Topics include machine architecture registers I O basic assembly language memory models pointers memory allocation data representation compilation stack frames semantic analysis code generation and basic concurrency threading synchronization Principles of Computer Systems CS110 CS110 will teach students how to build larger scale systems using operating system and networking abstractions Topics include processes threading context switching interprocess communication storage and file management file systems virtual memory networking sockets TCP IP routing and an understanding of distributed systems Theory Mathematical Foundations of Computing CS103 CS103 will give students the mathematical foundations necessary for computer science Topics include proof techniques and logic induction sets functions and relations an introduction to formal languages DFA s NFA s and Regular Expressions Context Free Grammars Turing Machines and NP Completeness Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists CS109 CS109 is designed to teach students material from probability and statistics that is relevant to computer science Topics include combinatorics probability theory conditional probability and independence probability distributions Bayes Theorem Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem and hypothesis testing The class will also cover applications of probability including hashing data analysis inference and an introduction to machine learning Data Structures and Algorithms CS161 CS161 gives students the tools to analyze data structures and algorithms Students will also practice devising algorithms for various problems These skills are widely applicable and alumni report CS161 as one of the most useful classes at Stanford Topics include algorithmic complexity analysis Big Oh Omega Theta recurrence relations and the master method In addition students learn about several different classes of algorithms and data structures including randomized algorithms divide and conquer strategies greedy algorithms hasing heaps graph algorithms and search algorithms including blind and A search Track The tracks allow students to develop depth in a particular specialization by taking 4 5 courses in a related area Students must complete the requirements for any one track which typically includes 1 2 gateway classes 1 2 classes form a menu of highly related courses and then a selection of classes from a list of more broadly related courses The current tracks are Artificial Intelligence Theory Systems Human Computer Interaction Graphics Information Biocomputation Unspecialized and Individually Designed For details about individual tracks and advice for choosing a track see the tracks page For more details about the specific academic requirements for each track please refer to the relevant program sheet Electives Some people use the electives to explore a broader array of topics in CS by taking additional introductory classes in different areas Others use them to pursue a particular topic in more depth by taking some of the higher level graduate classes This provides students additional flexibility to build a broader base of knowledge in CS or related areas or focus on a more specific topic For students doing research professors or advisors will be able to recommend relevant classes that can be used as electives The elective requirements can be fulfilled by taking classes from either of two lists the general CS electives list or the list of classes that fulfill the elective requirements specific to each track These track specific electives often include classes outside the CS department to allow for interdisciplinary work Check out a program sheet for the full list of available classes If you think a class should be on the list of approved general CS electives or a track specific electives list check out the Petitions section Senior Project Writing In the Major There are several options available for completing the senior project requirement The senior project class CS194 is the most common way In this class students work in teams to build a significant programming application learning and practicing useful strategies for software design and engineering At the end of the class students demo their projects in front of the other students course staff and representatives from many local companies CS294 fulfills the WIM requirement A second popular way to fulfill the senior project requirement is to take CS210 Project Experience with Corporate Partners This is a two quarter sequence where students work on loosely defined challenges defined by corporate partners R D labs Each team functions as a small startup company with dedicated space a discretionary budget and a technical advisory board comprised of the instructional staff The two quarter sequence affords time to experiment benchmark and try out different ideas before zeroing in on a particular direction The two quarter time frame also means provides enough time to build something of lasting impact This is class is also a great opportunity to develop relationships with a company and learn skills that are helpful for managing a team or starting a company Another option for senior project is to undertake individual research with a faculty member under the auspices of CS191 or CS191W CS191W is the writing intensive version that involves several writing assignments and fulfills the WIM requirement Doing a research based senior project can provide additional valuable experience for students interested in a research career Taking CS191 requires finding a faculty member who will oversee the project See the research page for more information on how to do this Students taking CS191 must also fill out a senior project proposal form and get the approvoal of their advisor and Patrick Young Another research based option to fulfill the senior project requirement is to do a senior honors thesis Writing an honors thesis includes a year long research project supervised by a CS faculty member Applications for the honors program are due by May 1 For more information see the Honors Page A final option for the senior project is CS294 the directed research classes If you d like to take part in active research but don t have a specific project in mind or would like some guidance CS294 might be for you The class is typically focused on a single large project of the professor s interest People choose or are assigned parts of the larger project to work on for the quarter For example in the past CS294 students contributed to the award winning DARPA Grand Challenge robot The topics for CS294 change each year though it s frequently been led by an AI professor Professors may expect students to be comfortable with techniques used in the field For example an AI CS294 might expect you to have taken CS221 Like CS191 students can opt to do a writing intensive version CS294W that fulfills the WIM requirement Almost everyone fulfills the WIM requirement when they do their senior project If you took CS201 for your TIS requirement then you do not need to fulfill WIM with senior project WIM is the only requirement that can be fulfilled by a class that also fulfills another requirement See the senior project page for more details Transfer Credit In order to receive transfer credit for anything on the front of the program sheet you must go through the School of Engineering Anything on the back of the program sheet requires approval of the CS Department To request an approval send an email to Jerry Cain jerry cs and CC it to Meredith Hutchin hutchin cs Include the Stanford class for

https://cs.stanford.edu/degrees/undergrad/Considering.shtml ##### Stanford University Undergraduate Major in Computer Science Home Declaring The Major Program Sheets The Minor The Coterm Petitions Transfer Credit Events Who To See Considering CS We re so glad you re considering CS at Stanford If you are a High School student considering the CS major at Stanford you might also want to check out the High School FAQ If you are enrolled at Stanford and considering majoring in CS but are not quite ready to declare you can sign up for the considering cs list We forward selected departmental announcements social events and class changes to this list periodically If you are ready to declare you may want to look at the pages on Choosing an Advisor or Declaring CS Exciting Aspects of Stanford CS Research Undergraduates in CS have opportunities to get involved in research With faculty and resources that are among the strongest in the world a great deal of leading edge academic research has been and continues to be carried out at Stanford If you show that you can do the work you can get involved in this type of research as an undergraduate which will provide you with extraordinarily valuable training for future work in the field The department also has a special program called CURIS which provides research opportunities for students during the summer Please see the Research page for more information Teaching Undergraduates in CS have opportunities to get involved in teaching The discussion sections for the introductory CS106 courses are led primarily by undergraduates As a section leader you ll have the chance to teach the next generation of CS majors and get them excited about programming If you have done well in your CS courses and can demonstrate both an aptitude for and an interest in teaching you should check out the online application Internships and Jobs The Stanford CS department is right in the middle of Silicon Valley The department has excellent connections to local companies many of which were founded by people connected with the department These connections provide help in getting summer internships as well as permanent positions after graduation Check out the Recruiting page for more information Getting Started The usual first step in learning about computer science is to take CS106 Even if you don t end up majoring in CS this class will serve you well in most engineering and scientific disciplines Because students enter Stanford with varying backgrounds there are two different paths through the CS106 course The standard introductory sequence for students without significant background in computing is to take CS106A followed by CS106B For those with some experience in programming or who have passed the CS AP exam you can reach basically the same point by taking the one quarter course CS106X CS106X covers the same topics as CS106B but with more in depth coverage and at a faster pace Note that it is also possible to take CS106X rather than CS106B after taking CS106A Even if you ve had a considerable amount of prior programming experience you might still want to take CS106X particularly if you do not know C By doing so you will learn a lot more about how to develop well engineered software and get a more solid foundation for more advanced work than you are likely to have from high school programming courses If you haven t done much programming before or don t feel comfortable with your programming skills take the CS106A B sequence Don t let anyone tell you that real engineers take CS106X Students who take the CS106A B sequence still go on to be very successful computer scientists No matter which course you take you will learn about the C programming language along with many fundamental programming concepts and software engineering techniques The Major Requirements As a CS major you are required to complete School of Engineering requirements which include math science and engineering fundamentals core CS classes depth courses within a chosen track and a senior capstone project For the full major requirements check out our Major Requirements page Our current tracks are Artificial Intelligence Biocomputation Computer Engineering Graphics Human Computer Interaction Information Systems Theory Unspecialized Individually Designed For details about individual tracks and advice for choosing a track see the tracks page For more details about the specific academic requirements for each track please refer to the relevant program sheet After Graduation After Stanford computer science majors typically have many options in terms of pursuing their interest in the field Many students get jobs immediately after leaving Stanford both here in Silicon Valley and elsewhere Others choose to pursue graduate studies in computer science specializing in a diverse set of areas Since the computer science curriculum gives students a broad exposure to the subject matter within the field graduates are usually prepared to pursue any subfield in their graduate studies For those who want to go on to graduate study the first decision is whether to pursue a master s degree or a Ph D The master s degree usually consists of additional coursework and will give you a stronger foundation of the same sort you had as an undergraduate Getting a Ph D is a much longer commitment often five or more years the core of which is an independent research project leading to a doctoral dissertation Still other graduates choose to pursue other forms of graduate studies obtaining an M B A J D or M D after receiving their B S in computer science At Stanford you can pursue both a B S and M S degree concurrently by participating in the coterminal master s program or coterm for short This program is extremely popular in computer science with students from a variety of undergraduate backgrounds including CS CSE EE Psychology etc pursuing an MSCS You may apply to this program as soon as you ve completed 120 units up until the quarter before you finish your undergraduate degree Applications to the program are available from Graduate Admissions in the Gates Building Room 196 and differ very little from the regular application to the masters program in computer science Students accepted to the coterminal program who have completed 180 units or more are officially considered graduate students and are therefore eligible to get teaching and research assistantships graduate tuition rates and so forth Options for Studying CS Computer Science Major At Stanford most students interested in learning about computing major in computer science Within the CS major students can pursue many different interests such as artificial intelligence programming languages systems and networking graphics databases theory of computation human computer interaction robotics and biocomputation The CS major is quite flexible and meets the needs of most students Computer Science Minor A minor in CS exposes students to the undergraduate core of the CS major and gives them the opportunity to explore the major without the full engineering or course requirements It consists of six to eight classes and is suited for schedules permitting two years By completing the minor students will gain a strong foundation in programming fundamentals and will be introduced to the theoretical branch of Computer Science Furthermore through two electives students can take more advanced classes in areas they find interesting Electrical Engineering Some students interested in computer science particularly those who are even more interested in hardware than those in CSE major in electrical engineering which has several undergraduate degree options that involve computer science Like the CS department the EE department is no longer ABET accredited While such accreditation is useful in certain disciplines such as civil engineering it has no practical significance whatsoever in computer science Mathematical and Computational Sciences Mathematical and computational science MCS presents an opportunity to combine aspects of computer science with classes in pure mathematics The major requires a core set of classes which include the introductory computer science classes such as CS103 and CS106 along with a variety of math classes Beyond these core classes students are allowed to pick an emphasis in either computer science or mathematics after which they select appropriate course work to complete the unit requirements for the major Symbolic Systems Symbolic systems is an interdisciplinary program that combines computer science psychology philosophy and linguistics in order to better understand cognition in both humans and machines Viewing people and computers as symbol processors the symbolic systems major strives to understand how people and computers reason perceive and act Within the symbolic systems major there is a core set of required classes beyond this core students choose an area of concentration in order to gain depth Useful Links CS Undergraduate Website CS Course Offerings Stanford Bulletin and Course Catalog Undergraduate Engineering Handbook Undergraduate Admissions CS

https://cs.stanford.edu/degrees/undergrad/Research.shtml ##### Stanford University Undergraduate Major in Computer Science Home Declaring The Major Program Sheets The Minor The Coterm Petitions Transfer Credit Events Who To See Undergraduate Research Stanford faculty and students do amazing research The projects here are widely recognized as some of the best in the world and Stanford holds its reputation as one of the top CS programs in large part from this Your time at Stanford offers a unique opportunity to be involved in cutting edge research What is the difference between CURIS academic year research and honors thesis research CURIS CURIS is the program for undergraduate summer research in Computer Science Each summer some professors take undergraduates to work on their projects Participating students are expected to work on these projects full time and will be paid a stipend to cover living expenses The CURIS site has a list of the projects available that is usually updated sometime near the end of January with new projects for the upcoming summer The application deadline for CURIS is mid winter quarter Academic Year Research Students can also opt to participate in research during the academic year This is typically done for course credit More information on finding a project and what class to enroll in can be found in the answers to the subsequent questions Honors Thesis The Honors Thesis is a one year research project for students in their senior year During their Junior year students decide on a topic find a faculty sponsor and apply to the program During their senior year students take 3 units per quarter as independent study units and at the end of the year they write a thesis Most students who choose to write an honors thesis have research experience prior to the start of their honors project More information is available at the Honors website How can I learn about available research opportunities There many different ways to find out about research projects at Stanford Some examples are listed below Undergraduate CS Research Website The most reliable way to learn about projects you can get involved in it through the Undergraduate CS Research website Throughout the year professors have openings for undergrads to do work in their labs They post descriptions of these projects on the site for your perusal This site lists CS research project during the academic year for course credit CS research projects for the summer quarter under CURIS paid internship and research projects in other departments that include applications of CS Go to Office Hours Find a professor whose research interests you want to learn more about Discuss what possibilities are available or just find out more about what a particular group is doing Often the professor will be able to direct you to some research papers that might be valuable to read or some other groups that you might find interesting It s always a good idea to email a professor and let him or her know that you will be coming in That way if their office hours are particularly busy they can suggest another time Talk to a Grad Student Because the graduate students work on the projects every day and deal with most of the details they are probably one of the best sources of information They will have a good idea for what role you could initially play in the project and will also be able to give an honest assessment of what it is like to work with the professor and what are the expectations of the group Finally if you decide to work with the group the graduate students will probably be the ones that will be mentoring you in the day to day aspects of your work Before you choose a project try to meet with at least one graduate student in the group preferably one that would be mentoring you If you are still deciding between projects ask the graduate students what they think you d be surprised at how helpful and honest they can be Read Your Email The BSCS list is constantly getting announcements about presentations that are being given by faculty advanced graduate students and visiting faculty Take the time to read through some of the abstracts and pick a few that interest you Note that these announcements are not usually forwarded to the considering cs list If you are interested in getting these announcements come visit the Course Advisor and declare CS Attend Seminars and Presentations In addition to the talks and presentations that are announced by email there are some CS seminar series that are especially appropriate for learning about research Some of these are available as a 1 unit class or you can also just come in and hear the speakers that interest you CS 300 At the beginning of each academic year all new PhD students are required to take CS 300 In each seminarEach day two professors come in and describe their research work The idea is to give PhD students an overview of the ongoing research so they can decide which groups they would like to join Although the class is technically for PhD students undergraduate and masters students can enroll The presentations are likely to be somewhat technical but since they are geared towards PhD students with a broad variety of interests they should be fairly accessible You can also find the speaker schedule online 500 Level Seminars All of the CS 500 level courses are topic seminars For instance CS 547 is a seminar on Human Computer Interaction topics Each week a different speaker comes in and presents their research Sometimes the speakers are Stanford professors sometimes they re graduate students and sometimes they re outside visitors The presentations are often quite technical but if you check the schedules on the class webpages you should be able to find some talks that interest you CURIS Poster Session At the end of the summer quarter and the beginning of the fall quarter the CURIS program organizes poster sessions for undergraduates to present their summer research projects This is a great opportunity for you to get first hand information about your peers research experience as well as potential project ideas and research groups of interest In addition the display in the Gates lobby shows a collection of both undergraduate and graduate research projects year round What classes do I sign up for if I m doing research Undergraduate research is often done through CURIS for academic credit or through an informal arrangement with a professor Independent Study Research Classes 191 191W 195 199 399 CS 191 is a one quarter research project that fulfills the Senior Project requirement 191W is the Writing in the Major version of this course Students must set up their own project find a faculty sponsor and submit a proposal More information is available at the Senior Project website CS 195 is a one quarter research project that fulfills a CS elective on the undergraduate program sheet up to 4 units for students who are not yet eligible to take CS 191 Students must work under faculty supervision and get prior approval for their project CS 199 undergrad and CS 399 masters are one quarter independent studies for students who have already taken 4 units of CS 195 but are not eligible for CS 191 These units will count towards the university wide graduation requirements but not toward the CS major itself For all of these classes students can propose a project of their own or can find and receive approval for a project listed on the Undergraduate CS Research website All students must get prior approval from their faculty sponsor at the very least before signing up from any of these classes Research Project Course 294 294W Students can also opt for CS 294 or 294W the WIM version of the course which fulfills the senior project requirement and allows students to get involved in a major ongoing research project Check the course listing to see which research areas are covered in 294 for any given year Research Course Flowchart Still not sure what course is right for you That s alright Take a look at this flow chart Why should I do research If you might be interested in getting a PhD research experience is almost a prerequisite for admission to the top graduate programs and if you think you might like to be a professor or researcher someday you should absolutely make undergraduate research a top priority If you re not yet sure about your post graduation plans doing research as an undergraduate might help you decide if you are interested in continuing on to graduate school and working in academia Even if you aren t planning to go to graduate school participating in research can make you much more employable The most sought after students tend to be the ones with significant experience regardless of whether the research is directly applicable to the job Pursuing a research project requires you to be extremely self reliant and self motivated attributes that employers value highly If you think you might want to write an undergraduate honors thesis you will need to complete a research project Most students who write a thesis will have engaged in research prior to senior year and these prior experiences ultimately help them succeed in completing a thesis Finally doing individual research is challenging in ways classes are not Because they have been involved in research worked hard and learned these valuable skills students who have been involved in research tend to be at the top of their graduating classes What background do I need to start doing research The background that different groups require varies wildly Certain groups will require you to have advanced programming skills a strong math background or basic knowledge of the research area Other groups will have ways for students to get involved and contribute even if they haven t taken many CS courses yet For instance some groups are happy to take on frosh because they have many years ahead of them at Stanford and have lots of time to learn and do great work There are plenty of opportunities to contribute to a research project before your senior year so don t wait until you ve finished half the major to get involved Since the prerequisites for starting work on a research project vary widely among research areas and professors talk to a professor to get their advice Many professors teach an introductory class centering broadly on their research area and if you contact them will ask you to take that class If you get this response from a professor the best way to get into his or her research group is to take and ace this class If you re not sure yet whether you re interested in a particular topic the intro class would also be a good place for you to find out more about it In any case professors criteria for taking on students vary widely and if you are interested in working with a particular professor find out what classes to take or what to do in order to be considered for their research group You can email the professor or visit their office hours to ask It s best to do this as soon as possible because they ll often be able to give advice on courses to take that you haven t thought of and if you miss a course or its prerequisites you may have to wait a whole year to take it Do I need to have a specific project in mind No Most students start on research without having a particular project in mind Most professors supervise one or more research groups which typically consist of the professor s PhD students MS students and often a few undergraduate students Each group usually works on a significant project or idea with each student working on a key piece of it If you don t have a particular project in mind one of the best ways to get involved with research is to join one of these groups You ll probably spend some time helping with generic tasks and learning about the project Don t underestimate the value of this opportunity you ll get an inside look at how research is done and learn a lot about jumping into a large project something you ll have to do at almost any job you have after graduation After you spend some time with the group you or the professor will probably start to find particular aspects of the project that you can work on At this point you can discuss with your professor the best way to proceed with taking on more responsibility for a part of the project What should you do if you already have your own idea for a project In some cases students have a particular project or idea that they want to pursue so they find a professor with similar research interests and ask him or her to be the advisor for the project The professor provides guidance and suggestions while the student does the detailed research and experiments Getting started in research this way is less common and usually works only for students who are fairly far into the major or who have already had significant work experience in their field of interest but it is still possible How can I make my research experience a good one Many undergraduates who do research will consider it to be one of their best experiences at Stanford Although nothing can guarantee that your experience will be a good one here are a few tried and true tips for making your research experience enjoyable and rewarding Clearly define your expectations for the project Before you start working on any sort of research project make sure you ve sat down with the professor or the graduate student who will be supervising you and discussed exactly what you will be working on Every year at least one person has all sorts of complaints because they spent their whole summer working on a CURIS project they felt was drastically above or below their ability The professor has no way of knowing what you are willing and able to do if you don t communicate with them Before you take on a project make sure you understand what sort of day to day work is involved and that you are excited and happy about the opportunity You should also know who will be supervising you on a day to day basis and who you can turn to for advice and guidance if you run into problems Define how much time you can devote to research Nothing is worse than a flaky member of a group project As an undergraduate you have many commitments outside research It s therefore important to sit down with your professor or grad student supervisor and define exactly how much time you have available for the project and when you will be around If you know that you will be working on a class project 24 7 during dead week be sure to communicate that to your group and make sure that it s acceptable for you to be gone during that time Nothing is more frustrating to a research group than students who don t show up in lab and don t respond to emails Disappearing with your part of the project can delay others work Remember that research is the primary focus of PhD students and they will not be happy waiting around for you to get back to them and finish your work If this happens you will likely find yourself never assigned anything important again If however you ve outlined when you will be gone your group can plan around it and people won t be frustrated and disappointed when you disappear to finish that big project or study for finals Set specific hours when you will be at the lab working on your research This makes it easy for people to find you when they need to talk about work You will also be perceived as a reliable hard worker rather than someone who is sometimes around sometimes not depends how busy she is Many people who do research during the school year find that it keeps getting pushed off because everything else has a deadline By scheduling time to put into your research and sticking to it you ll avoid this situation and be less likely to disappoint yourself and your research group Take on the appropriate amount of work It is always better to do a great job on a small project than to do a bad job on a huge project Many graduate students are more experienced and have much more time to devote to research so they may expect you to be able to accomplish more than you have time to do Make sure your part of the project is something you can manage and make sure to deliver on any promises you make to your professor or research group Communicate with your group and professor Professors and graduate students are not mind readers If you re unhappy about something or might not be able to make a deadline make sure to bring it up in a non confrontational way and try to do so early Problems are always easier to solve if they have just started than if you have been silently steaming about them for six weeks Also be sure to communicate about the things that are going well If you are really excited about a certain aspect of your work let someone know The next time something similar comes along they ll be much more likely to send it your way How do I approach a professor Professors are people who have decided that their research is really interesting and important The fact that you are considering doing research and might go on to follow in their footsteps is really exciting to them They are much happier to talk to individual students about their research than they are to grade your midterms Also keep in mind that professors are judged by the quality of the research done by their groups and whether their groups manage to produce great students If it s possible that you will be a productive and useful person in their group while learning lots of things that s incredibly exciting and helpful to them as well Professors also deal with endless requests from graduate students not to mention people who haven t even been admitted to Stanford to join their lab in return for funding The fact that someone wants to join their lab just to learn is a great feeling for them With few exceptions most professors will be happy to talk with undergraduates about doing research and will do their best to find some way for you to contribute That being said keep in mind that professors also tend to be some of the busiest people on the planet Be respectful of their time as well as their knowledge and you will get a much better response Before contacting a professor for the first time take thirty seconds to check if they have a FAQ on their homepage that answers your questions and before you go in take time to read about the projects in which you are interested Professors are much more likely to respond to emails that show clear interest to specific research projects in the group compared to a generic email with your resume Also be willing to let them direct you to information rather than explain it all in person instead of demanding a personal tour of the lab ask if they can suggest some good papers for you to read or if there is a particular graduate student you should talk to If you

M WYSIWYG Computational Photography via Viewfinder Editing Proc ACM SIGGRAPH Asia 2013 You can find my slides 90MB here Also shown at Eurographics 2014 Industrial Presentations Abstract Digital cameras with electronic viewfinders provide a relatively faithful depiction of the final image providing a WYSIWYG experience If however the image is created from a burst of differently captured images or non linear interactive edits significantly alter the final outcome then the photographer cannot directly see the results but instead must imagine the post processing effects This paper explores the notion of viewfinder editing which makes the viewfinder more accurately reflect the final image the user intends to create We allow the user to alter the local or global appearance tone color saturation or focus via stroke based input and propagate the edits spatiotemporally The system then delivers a real time visualization of these modifications to the user and drives the camera control routines to select better capture parameters Check out the paper video watch in 720p Alternatively try http vimeo com 71116200 Follow the link and click on HD Baek J Adams A B Dolson J Lattice Based High Dimensional Gaussian Filtering and the Permutohedral Lattice Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision 2013 For a locally stored copy click here Abstract High dimensional Gaussian filtering is a popular technique in image processing geometry processing and computer graphics for smoothing data while preserving important features For instance the bilateral filter cross bilateral filter and non local means filter fall under the broad umbrella of high dimensional Gaussian filters Recent algorithmic advances therein have demonstrated that by relying on a sampled representation of the underlying space one can obtain speed ups of orders of magnitude over the naive approach The simplest such sampled representation is a lattice and it has been used successfully in the bilateral grid and the permutohedral lattice algorithms In this paper we analyze these lattice based algorithms developing a general theory of lattice based high dimensional Gaussian filtering We consider the set of criteria for an optimal lattice for filtering as it offers a good tradeoff of quality for computational efficiency and evaluate the existing lattices under the criteria In particular we give a rigorous exposition of the properties of the permutohedral lattice and argue that it is the optimal lattice for Gaussian filtering Lastly we explore further uses of the permutohedral lattice based Gaussian filtering framework showing that it can be easily adapted to perform mean shift filtering and yield improvement over the traditional approach based on a Cartesian grid Cho S I Gao S S Xia A Wang R Salles F T Raphael P D Abaya H Wachtel J Baek J Jacobs D E Rasband M N Oghalai J S Mechanisms of hearing loss after blast injury to the ear PLoS One 2013 Vol 8 No 7 Abstract Given the frequent use of improvised explosive devices IEDs around the world the study of traumatic blast injuries is of increasing interest The ear is the most common organ affected by blast injury because it is the body s most sensitive pressure transducer We fabricated a blast chamber to re create blast profiles similar to that of IEDs and used it to develop a reproducible mouse model to study blast induced hearing loss The tympanic membrane was perforated in all mice after blast exposure and found to heal spontaneously Micro computed tomography demonstrated no evidence for middle ear or otic capsule injuries however the healed tympanic membrane was thickened Auditory brainstem response and distortion product otoacoustic emission threshold shifts were found to be correlated with blast intensity As well these threshold shifts were larger than those found in control mice that underwent surgical perforation of their tympanic membranes indicating cochlear trauma Histological studies one week and three months after the blast demonstrated no disruption or damage to the intra cochlear membranes However there was loss of outer hair cells OHCs within the basal turn of the cochlea and decreased spiral ganglion neurons SGNs and afferent nerve synapses Using our mouse model that recapitulates human IED exposure our results identify that the mechanisms underlying blast induced hearing loss does not include gross membranous rupture as is commonly believed Instead there is both OHC and SGN loss that produce auditory dysfunction Given the frequent use of improvised explosive devices IEDs around

Science Tech Report CSTR 2012 01 Abstract Many cameras provide insufficient control over depth of field Some have a fixed aperture others have a variable aperture that is either too small or too large to produce the desired amount of blur To overcome this limitation one can capture a focal stack which is a collection of images each focused at a different depth then combine these slices to form a single composite that exhibits the desired depth of field In this paper we present a theory of focal stack compositing and algorithms for computing images with extended depth of field shallower depth of field than the lens aperture naturally provides or even freeform non physical depth of field We show that while these composites are subject to halo artifacts there is a principled methodology for avoiding these artifacts by feathering a slice selection map according to certain rules before computing the composite image Karpenko A Jacobs D E Baek J and Levoy M Digital Video Stabilization and Rolling Shutter Correction using Gyroscopes Stanford Computer Science Tech Report CSTR 2011 03 Abstract In this paper we present a robust real time video stabilization and rolling shutter correction technique based on commodity gyroscopes First we develop a unified algorithm for modeling camera motion and rolling shutter warping We then present a novel framework for automatically calibrating the gyroscope and camera outputs from a single video capture This calibration allows us to use only gyroscope data to effectively correct rolling shutter warping and to stabilize the video Using our algorithm we show results for videos featuring large moving foreground objects parallax and low illumination We also compare our method with commercial image based stabilization algorithms We find that our solution is more robust and computationally inexpensive Finally we implement our algorithm directly on a mobile phone We demonstrate that by using the phone s inbuilt gyroscope and GPU we can remove camera shake and rolling shutter artifacts in real time Baek J Jacobs D E Accelerating Spatially Varying Gaussian Filters Proc ACM SIGGRAPH Asia 2010 Abstract High dimensional Gaussian filters most notably the bilateral filter are important tools for many computer graphics and vision tasks In recent years a number of techniques for accelerating their evaluation have been developed by exploiting the separability of these Gaussians However these techniques do not apply to the more general class of spatially varying Gaussian filters as they cannot be expressed as convolutions These filters are useful because the underlying data e g images range data meshes or light fields often exhibit strong local anisotropy and scale We propose an acceleration method for approximating spatially varying Gaussian filters using a set of spatially invariant Gaussian filters each of which is applied to a segment of some non disjoint partitioning of the dataset We then demonstrate that the resulting ability to locally tilt rotate or scale the kernel improves filtering performance in various applications over traditional spatially invariant Gaussian filters without incurring a significant penalty in computational expense Adams A B Talvala E Park S H Jacobs D E Ajdin B Gelfand N Dolson J Vaquero D Baek J Tico M Lensch H P A Matusik W Pulli K Horowitz M and Levoy M The Frankencamera an Experimental Platform for Computational Photography Proc ACM SIGGRAPH 2010 Abstract Although there has been much interest in computational photography within the research and photography communities progress has been hampered by the lack of a portable programmable camera with sufficient image quality and computing power To address this problem we have designed and implemented an open architecture and API for such cameras the Frankencamera It consists of a base hardware specification a software stack based on Linux and an API for C Our architecture permits control and synchronization of the sensor and image processing pipeline at the microsecond time scale as well as the ability to incorporate and synchronize external hardware like lenses and flashes This paper specifies our architecture and API and it describes two reference implementations we have built Using these implementations we demonstrate six computational photography applications HDR viewfinding and capture low light viewfinding and capture automated acquisition of extended dynamic range panoramas foveal imaging IMU based hand shake detection and rephotography Our goal is to standardize the architecture and distribute Frankencameras to researchers and students as a step towards creating a community of photographer programmers who develop algorithms applications and hardware for computational cameras Dolson J Baek J Plagemann C and Thrun S Upsampling Range Data in Dynamic Environments Proc IEEE CVPR 2010 Abstract We present a flexible method for fusing information from optical and range sensors based on an accelerated high dimensional filtering approach Our system takes as input a sequence of monocular camera images as well as a stream of sparse range measurements as obtained from a laser or other sensor system In contrast with existing approaches we do not assume that the depth and color data streams have the same data rates or that the observed scene is fully static Our method produces a dense high resolution depth map of the scene automatically generating confidence values for every interpolated depth point We describe how to integrate priors on object shape motion and appearance and how to achieve an efficient implementation using parallel processing hardware such as GPUs Baek J Transfer Efficiency and Depth Invariance in Computational Cameras Proc IEEE ICCP 2010 Abstract Recent advances in computational cameras achieve extension of depth of field by modulating the aperture of an imaging system either spatially or temporally They are however accompanied by loss of image detail the chief cause of which is low and or depth varying frequency response of such systems In this paper we examine the tradeoff between achieving depth invariance and maintaining high transfer efficiency by providing a mathematical framework for analyzing the transfer function of these computational cameras Using this framework we prove mathematical bounds on the efficacy of the tradeoff These bounds lead to observations on the fundamental limitations of computational cameras In particular we show that some existing designs are already near optimal in our metrics Adams A B Baek J and Davis M A Fast High Dimensional Filtering using the Permutohedral Lattice Proc Eurographics 2010 Best Paper Runner Up Abstract Many useful algorithms for processing images and geometry fall under the general framework of high dimensional Gaussian filtering This family of algorithms includes bilateral filtering and non local means We propose a new way to perform such filters using the permutohedral lattice which tessellates high dimensional space with uniform simplices Our algorithm is the first implementation of a high dimensional Gaussian filter that is both linear in input size and polynomial in dimensionality Furthermore it is parameter free apart from the filter size and achieves a consistently high accuracy relative to ground truth 45 dB We use this to demonstrate a number of interactive rate applications of filters in as high as eight dimensions Dissertations Baek J WYSIWYG Computational Photography via Viewfinder Editing Doctor of Philosophy Thesis Stanford University 2013 PDF Abstract The past decade witnessed a rise in the ubiquity and capability of digital photography paced by the advances in embedded devices image processing and social media Along with it the popularity of computational photography also grew Many computational photography techniques work by first capturing a coded representation of the scene a stack of photographs with different settings an image obtained via a modified optical path et cetera and then computationally decoding it later as a post process according to the user s specification However the coded representation available to the user at the time of capture is often not sufficiently indicative of the decoded output that will be produced later Depending on the type of the computational photography technique involved the coded representation may appear to be a distorted image or may not even be an image at all Consequently these techniques discard one of the most significant attractions of digital photography the what you see is what you get WYSIWYG experience In response this dissertation explores a new kind of interface for manipulating images in computational photography applications called viewfinder editing With viewfinder editing the viewfinder more accurately reflects the final image the user intends to create by allowing the user to alter the local or global appearance of the photograph via stroke based input on a touch enabled digital viewfinder and propagating the edits spatiotemporally Furthermore the user specifies via the interface how the coded representation should be decoded in computational photography applications guiding the acquisition and composition of photographs and giving immediate visual feedback to the user Thus the WYSIWYG aspect is reclaimed enriching the user s photographing experience and helping him make artistic decisions before or during capture instead of after capture This dissertation realizes and presents a real time implementation of viewfinder editing on a mobile platform constituting the first of its kind This implementation is enabled by a new spatiotemporal edit propagation method that meaningfully combines and improves existing algorithms achieving an order of magnitude speed up over existing methods The new method trades away spatial locality for efficiency and robustness against camera or scene motion Finally several applications of the framework are demonstrated such as high dynamic range HDR multi exposure photography focal stack composition selective colorization and general tonal editing In particular new camera control algorithms for stack metering and focusing are presented which takes advantage of the knowledge of the user s intent indicated via the viewfinder editing interface and optimizes the camera parameters accordingly Baek J Multi channel coded aperture photography Master of Engineering Thesis MIT 2008 PDF Abstract This thesis describes the multi channel coded aperture photography a modified camera system that can extract an all focus image of the scene along with a depth estimate over the scene The modification consists of inserting a set of patterned color filters into the aperture of the camera lens This work generalizes the previous research on a single channel coded aperture by deploying distinct filters in the three primary color channels in order to cope better with the effect of a Bayer filter and to exploit the correlation among the channels We derive the model and algorithms for the multi channel coded aperture comparing the simulated performance of the reconstruction algorithm against that of the original single channel coded aperture We also demonstrate a physical prototype discussing the challenges arising from the use of multiple filters We provide a comparison with the single channel coded aperture in performance and present results on several scenes of cluttered objects at various depths Education Here is a list of my accreditation These are also places I hold dear in my heart Received Ph D in Computer Science Stanford December 2013 Received M S in Computer Science Stanford

Building 1A Room 122 353 Serra Mall 146 Stanford CA 94305 9010 fon 650 725 8810 fax 650 725 1449 My new web page is at the University of Massachusetts Amherst What s on this page Short Bio Research Interests Introduction to my Research Recent Results Publications Miscellaneous Short Bio Currently I am working with my former advisor Oussama Khatib on various aspects of elastic planning for robots with many degrees of freedom such as humanoid robots Previously I was a lecturer and research scientist at Rice University with Professor Lydia Kavraki in the Physical Computing Group Spring 2000 I taught COMP430 Introduction to Databases Fall 2000 I was supposed to teach COMP584 Computational Geometry but unfortunately I had to leave Rice to fulfill other commitments back in California I also was a Ph D student at the Robotics Lab in the Computer Science department at Stanford University my advisor was Professor Oussama Khatib I started out at the Technical University Berlin studying Computer Science I wrote my master thesis in robotics in the group of Professor G nter Hommel back to the top Research Interests Currently mobile robots and mobile manipulators often perform poorly in unknown unstructured and dynamic environments By integrating motion planning and motion execution I attempt to design motion generation algorithms that combine the best of both worlds they are immune to local minima and guaranteed to reach the goal if possible like planning algorithms and achieve reactive real time obstacle avoidance like most execution paradigms The results of this work are the global dynamic window approach and the elastic strip framework see publications below I also have been working with Lydia Kavraki on decomposition based planning which can be viewed as a continuation of my work on Elastic Strips and promises to be a very powerful motion planning and motion generation approach with many applications in robotics and beyond Other research interests include motion planning and its applications to areas like computational molecular biology character animation virtual prototyping also collision avoidance mobile manipulation mobile robotics and computational geometry back to the top Introduction to my Research Global Dynamic Window Approach for mobile navigation in unknown and dynamic environments Elastic Strip Framework for real time replanning in high dimensional configuration spaces and motion execution in dynamic environments Decomposition based Motion Planning for real time motion planning in high dimensional configuration spaces back to the top Recent Results Task Consistent Obstacle Avoidance and Motion Behavior The elastic strip approach is an approach to real time replanning and motion execution in dynamic environments for robots with many degrees of freedom It allows the integration of various motion behaviors For example the end effector can execute a task while the redundant degrees of freedom are used for obstacle avoidance Below are three videos which resulted from work together with Sriram Viji on the left the elastic strip is used to avoid obstacles but the task is not maintained The video in the middle shows how task execution and obstacle avoidance can be integrated The task is to follow the red line with the end effector Watch how in the first video the end effector deviates significantly from the task so that the obstacles can be avoided In the second video the end effector does not deviate at all despite the fact that the obstacles perform the same motion as in the first video Sometimes constraints can make it impossible to perform the task In the case of the third video the end effector has to deviate from the task to avoid the second Scout robot The framework allows task suspension and automatic task resumption watch closely how the end effector deviates from the line and after passing the obstacle resumes the task Click on the images to see the movies 3MB 3MB 3MB You can also check out our video submission to ICRA 2002 Task Consistent Obstacle Avoidance for Mobile Manipulation 23MB 23MB Real Time Obstacle Avoidance and Posture Control for Humanoid Robots In these two videos you see the elastic strip approach applied to a humanoid robot with more than 30 degrees of freedom This is a fairly complicated environment in which one of the office chairs moves into the path of the robot and the upper beam of the door is lowered during the motion The left video shows how the robot moves without posture control The video on the right shows the same motion when a very simple posture behavior is imposed It does not look perfectly human yet but it serves well to illustrate the idea and the ease with which such posture can be integrated in the elastic strip framework In the future we will work on postures based on balance constraints and so on Click on the images to see the movies without posture 1MB with posture 1MB without posture 6MB with posture 6MB And here is another slightly humorous video showing a humanoid robot skiing The serious point here is to show how all degrees of freedom are used in real time to avoid obstacles Watch how the snowman moves into the path and how the finish sign is sliding down the poles Note how the ski poles move to avoid the snowman and to fit through the finish gate note also how the whole posture of the robot changes to pass under the finish sign Click on the image to see the movie 5MB Looking at this video you can imagine how these methods find direct applicability in character animation for movies or video games The motion of characters can be specified independently of other characters or objects in the scene and independently of the number of degrees of freedom at the task level This allows for more realistic games with higher interactivity for smaller production costs Local Replanning And I finally got around to creating a video answering the most frequently asked question What happens when an obstacle crosses the path and continues to move How does the elastic strip appraoch deal with that 3MB back to the top Publications Khatib Oussama Oliver Brock Kyong Sok Chang Francois Conti Diego Ruspini and Luis Sentis

restoring the statue 8 27 03 Download ScanView a program that lets you fly around our models of Michelangelo s statues no license required About the project Introduction Recent improvements in laser rangefinder technology together with algorithms developed at Stanford for combining multiple range and color images allow us to reliably and accurately digitize the external shape and surface characteristics of many physical objects Examples include machine parts cultural artifacts and design models for the manufacturing moviemaking and video game industries As an application of this technology a team of 30 faculty staff and students from Stanford University and the University of Washington spent the 1998 99 academic year in Italy scanning the sculptures and architecture of Michelangelo As a side project we also scanned 1 163 fragments of the Forma Urbis Romae a giant marble map of ancient Rome We are currently back in the United States processing the data we acquired Our goal is to produce a set of 3D computer models one for each statue architectural setting and map fragment we scanned and to make these models available to scholars worldwide The motivations behind this project are to advance the technology of 3D scanning to place this technology in the service of the humanities and to create a long term digital archive of some important cultural artifacts Our sponsors are Stanford University Interval Research Corporation and the Paul G Allen Foundation for the Arts Our collaborators a mix of computer scientists and art historians include the Italian museums and institutions whose names are listed below Timeline Since 1992 Professor Marc Levoy and his students have been investigating methods for digitizing the shape of three dimensional objects using laser scanners Our early efforts in this area were optimistically called the project to build a 3D fax machine In 1996 we digitized a small buddha statuette and emailed the computer model from Palo Alto to a fabrication facility in Los Angeles where an accurate replica was made thus demonstrating at least the feasibility of building such a machine Ours was not the only research group working on 3D digitization By 1996 a group at the National Research Council of Canada was regularly scanning museum and heritage artifacts However nobody had digitized a large statue with enough precision to serve as a primary resource for scientific work and nobody had tried to digitize a large and coherent collection of statuary Hence the impetus for the Digital Michelangelo Project Our project officially began in January of 1997 with a two year planning period During this period we designed built and tested a laser rangefinder and mechanical gantry customized for scanning large statues The requirements were demanding we wanted to capture chisel marks smaller than a millimeter we wanted to capture them from a safe distance and we wanted to reach the top of Michelangelo s David which stands 23 feet tall on its pedestal The final system which we call the Stanford Large Statue Scanner was fabricated for us by Cyberware of Monterey California For those hard to reach places we didn t move the statues we used a second scanner a jointed digitizing arm and small triangulation laser rangefinder made by Faro Technologies and 3D Scanners Ltd Finally to enable us to scan the architectural settings of Michelangelo s statues especially the new Sacristy of the Medici Chapels which he designed we used a prototype time of flight laser rangefinder made by Cyra Technologies All three systems also captured high resolution color data The production phase of the project from September of 1998 to June of 1999 consisted of scanning the artworks themselves For this purpose Professors Marc Levoy and Brian Curless Dr Kari Pulli and 7 graduate and 14 undergraduate students and staff listed below relocated to Italy for periods ranging from a few weeks to a year Professor levoy who stayed the longest managed to trade his condominium in Palo Alto for a memorable stay in a villa in Florence The first 4 months mid September through mid January of 1998 were spent converting the ground floor of a palazzo on the Arno River into a temporary computer graphics laboratory assembling and testing our scanners and writing software The next 5 months mid January through mid June of 1999 were spent moving from museum to museum digitizing artworks using our scanners and sending the data back to our laboratory for post processing During this period of intense activity we scanned 10 statues the David the four Unfinished Slaves and St Matthew all located in the Galleria dell Accademia in Florence the four allegorical statues Night Day Dawn and Dusk in the Medici Chapels also in Florence and the architectural settings of both museums Our largest dataset was of the David 2 billion polygons and 7 000 color images Augmenting our full time staff during the Winter academic quarter January March were 13 additional undergraduates from the Stanford Overseas Studies Program For everybody the project involved long hours our scan of the David was done only at night and unusual talents like strength the gantry weighed 1800 pounds and it had to be erected each time we moved to a different museum But the work was exciting and the data we came back with 250 gigabytes in all was worth the effort Of course not everything was work Here we are visiting the attic of Florence s Duomo and here the marble quarries at Pietrasanta Professor Levoy even tried his hand at carving marble At the point this timeline was written Autumn of 2000 we were working on building 3D models from our data It s a complicated task made harder by the unusually large size of our datasets For each statue and map fragment we must first clean up the raw scans then align them with each other merge them to form a seamless mesh fill holes in this mesh and finally map color photographic data onto it The resulting meshes contain hundreds of millions of polygons so even a simple task like displaying them on a computer is challenging Thus we re exploring new ways to compress transmit and render large polygon meshes efficiently At present we have built a full resolution model of one statue Michelangelo s St Matthew and several medium resolution models of a second the head of David Here are some newer color renderings of the David We have also built crude models of the other eight statues here are computer renderings of these models Some side projects Although our primary goal while in Italy was to scan the works of Michelangelo we became involved in several other projects during the year One such project was the acquisition of an ultraviolet fluorescence map of Michelangelo s David Once mapped onto our 3D computer model this data will show the location of waxes and other organic materials that have been applied to the statue over the centuries Addendum October 2002 Conservators recently used our model to help plan a major cleaning of the statue Here s a recently published book about the scientific studies that preceded the cleaning many of which used our 3D model of the statue To coincide with the cleaning we installed an interactive kiosk in the Galleria dell Accademia The kiosk allows museum visitors to rotate our 3D model of the David and play with its lighting This allows them to examine aspects of the statue that are difficult to see from the ground Another side project was the acquisition of a light field of Michelangelo s statue of Night Light fields a technique from a new branch of computer graphics called image based rendering consist of dense arrays of images of an object each image taken from a slightly different viewpoint Once a light field has been created perspective views from viewpoints not present in the original array can be constructed by combining pixels from the array s images Since rendering a light field involves only shuffling pixels not rendering polygons light fields can be viewed in real time on a PC having no hardware acceleration Although light fields do not directly provide 3D shape information about an object they might nevertheless be useful in some cultural heritage applications A final side project was the digitization of the fragments of the Forma Urbis Romae a giant map of ancient Rome carved onto marble slabs circa 200 A D The map lies in fragments 1 163 of them Piecing this map together has been one of the great unsolved problems of archeology Fortunately the fragments are several inches thick and the broken surfaces give us strong three dimensional cues for fitting the pieces back together Suppose one scanned these fragments could a computer program be written that could solve the jigsaw puzzle We are trying just that To give us the data we need we moved our computers and scanners to Rome we had an additional desktop laser scanner brought in from Palo Alto to increase our throughput and during a 3 week 24 hour a day scanning marathon in May and June of 1999 we digitized every fragment of the map In May of 2001 we scanned another 23 fragments that were unearthed after 1999 bringing the total to 1 186 Under the banner of the Digital Forma Urbis Romae Project we are currently assembling these scans to create 3D models of each map fragment and we are developing algorithms to help us solve the puzzle Creating a digital archive Although the task of building 3D models from our raw data is only partially complete we have received many requests for these models To satisfy this demand we have created a skeletal archive of 3D models and placed its catalog online The models in this archive are available to anyone but for scientific use only and users must first obtain a license in writing from us Although these licenses prohibit commercial use of the models permission for such uses can be obtained by applying to the Italian government One obvious commercial use is the creation of accurate physical replicas of the statues Here is a physical replica of the David we built as an experiment Although the methodologies needed to create and manage digital archives of two dimensional artifacts have matured substantially in the last ten years we are discovering that the jump from two to three dimensions poses new problems These are problems of both scale and substance and they touch on every aspect of digital archiving storage indexing searching distribution viewing and piracy protection To address these problems we have a pilot research project called Creating digital archives of 3D artworks sponsored by the National Science Foundation Digital Libraries Initiative One outcome of this project is ScanView a secure client server rendering system that permits unlicensed users to examine our 3D models but not extract the underlying data If you want to fly around our models of Michelangelo s statues but you don t qualify for a license try this viewer Current status of the project Since the summer of 2004 we have done no further work on the 3D models of Michelangelo s statues mainly for lack of funding and the time to seek additional funding As a result high quality models exist only of the David at 1 0 mm resolution 56 million triangles and St Matthew at 0 25 mm 372 million triangles A model also exists for Atlas at 0 25 mm approximately 500 million triangles but it contains alignment errors We welcome requests for licenses from any research group or institution that wishes to help us finish this monumental labor and solve some hard mesh alignmment and mesh completion problems in the process The fragments of the Forma Urbis Romae have fared somewhat better after 6 years of paid and volunteer student labor models now exist for every one of the 1 186 fragments These models which total nearly 8 billion polygons can be viewed without a license at this web site Photographic essays from the

be a relatively relaxing time for faculty with an emphasis on relatively most of us never really relax there s a surprising amount to do as department chair It all starts with commencement where the department chair s duty is to stand in the sun hand over about 250 diplomas shake 250 hands and pose for 250 photos and in my case do it all in elevated heels to slightly reduce the height gap between myself and your average computer science graduate Thankfully I wasn t department chair in the late 1990 s when basketball star Kate Starbird got her CS degree With commencement in the bag it s then time to plan the upcoming academic year Starting with the easy tasks I schedule the faculty meetings and faculty retreat and begin planning the speakers for our weekly informal faculty lunches Next up is to form a small committee for each faculty member up for promotion Although annual reviews for faculty are lightweight compared with say a typical corporation promotions in rank are a big big deal To assess research impact the committee solicits detailed letters from 15 senior professional colleagues at other top institutions We expect our faculty to be assessed at the very top of their peer group worldwide Teaching evaluations department and university service and service to the professional community are scrutinized The entire package makes its way from the promotion committee to the department to the school to the university If all goes well after several months the faculty member receives a congratulatory letter from President Hennessy and license to edit his or her letterhead and home page changing assistant professor to associate professor or associate professor to professor There s not even a salary bump It can actually be a bit anticlimactic With promotions underway my next job is to form departmental committees Here inertia is on my side We re not a department fraught with politics or power struggles quite the opposite So when a faculty member is doing a good job running a major committee his or her arm is twisted to keep doing it I m very grateful to stalwart committee chairs Profs John Mitchell Ph D program Alex Aiken faculty search Andrew Ng Ph D admissions David Cheriton M S admissions Mendel Rosenblum Computer Forum and last but hardly least Mehran Sahami associate chair for education Wow do they make my job a lot easier Even though CS faculty don t tend to get wrapped up in internal politics that doesn t mean they re incapable of whining quite the opposite once again So I make sure to send out committee membership assignments when the maximum number of faculty are on a summer holiday It s amazing how much less important certain things can seem to a faculty member when dealing with a week or two s worth of email backlog So there you have it the summer life of a department chair Oh right there s one more task that rolls around every summer writing this newsletter Please enjoy the many departmental highlights of the 2010 11 academic year New Promoted and Retired Faculty We ve been very busy hiring wonderfully talented new faculty First of all I somehow neglected to announce in last year s newsletter thatLuca Trevisan joined us as full professor in January 2010 that oversight is certainly not a reflection of Luca s importance to the department This spring we hired Ryan Williams who will join as assistant professor in fall 2011 and Percy Liang who will join as assistant professor in fall 2012 Here s a bit more about our three new faculty Luca Trevisan joined us from UC Berkeley where he had been on the CS faculty for about ten years Luca received his Ph D from the University La Sapienza in Rome was a post doc at MIT then joined the faculty at Columbia University before he was recruited to Berkeley Luca has some amazing results in computational complexity he brings great strength and senior leadership to our theory group Bolstering up our theory group even further we re delighted that Ryan Williams is joining us this fall Ryan received his Ph D from Carnegie Mellon in 2007 then was a post doc at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and the IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose When Ryan decided to accept our offer he famously tweeted Next fall I will be a professor at Stanford So that worked out but I m less optimistic about my new complexity theory startup MyPSPACE Also joining the ranks as a new assistant professor although not starting until fall 2012 Percy Liang bridges the areas of machine learning natural language understanding and programming languages Percy is finishing up his Ph D at UC Berkeley he ll be a post doc at Google in New York before settling at Stanford a year from now Incidentally Percy is also an active and very accomplished concert pianist demonstrating that computer scientists really can have significant lives beyond the office We had several promotions this past year see the newsletter introduction above for a bit more about what that entails Scott Klemmer Subhasish Mitra joint with EE and Tim Roughgarden were promoted to associate professor with tenure while Balaji Prabhakar joint with EE was promoted to full professor Congratulations to all four highly valued and productive members of our faculty January 2011 marked the retirement of Prof Jean Claude Latombe who has been on the faculty since 1987 Jean Claude played a leading role in the revival of the Robotics and AI Lab and he served ably as department chair from 1997 2000 Recently Jean Claude has been heading up our CS partnership with the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology KAUST an ambitious new university in Saudi Arabia described in last year s newsletter Jean Claude is extremely well known for his research and his widely used textbook in robot motion planning he performed seminal work on probabilistic roadmap planners a technique allowing the solution of problems with many more degrees of freedom than was possible before He also pioneered applications of robotics techniques in diverse fields such as medical surgery integration of design and manufacturing and graphic animation of digital actors In recent years he became interested in algorithmic problems in computational structural biology regarding the shape and motion of proteins and other biological macromolecules collaborating with many biologists Prior to joining Stanford Jean Claude was a professor at the National Polytechnic Institute of Grenoble and founder CEO of the French company ITMI Industry and Technology for Machine Intelligence Jean Claude has garnered many awards in his distinguished career one of the coolest is his recent ordainment as a Knight in the Ordre national du M rite Despite his large number of academic accomplishments Jean Claude steadfastly maintains a second life he s an adventurer par excellence focusing most of his far flung travels on trekking and mountaineering As just one example Jean Claude celebrated his retirement by completing a traverse of Nepal on foot something very few people have done Jean Claude will remain as a part time recalled faculty member for the next two years he ll be splitting his time between the department and the rest of the world literally New and Retired Lecturers In addition to the new faculty hires we ve hired a terrific new lecturer Keith Schwarz Keith is one of our own recent alumni receiving his BS in 2010 and his coterminal MS in 2011 We knew to expect great things from Keith when he created and taught his own course as a sophomore The course Standard C Programming Laboratory received outstanding reviews and grew to over 100 students during the years that Keith taught it Keith was no academic slouch either when he received his BS he was named the 2010 Ford Scholar the senior with the highest GPA across the entire School of Engineering We simply couldn t let Keith get away after graduating he will be joining the full time CS lecturer staff this fall At the other end of the career spectrum lecturer Bob Plummer retired this spring after 15 years of much appreciated service to the department Bob taught a variety of courses including introductory programming mathematical foundations of computing a course on NET programming and the Senior Project course As part of the Senior Project course Bob created the well known Software Project Faire where each spring students demonstrate their projects to a broad array of attendees including other students faculty and members of industry venture capital and the local community Bob was also involved in several other initiatives including a study on the efficacy of pair programming serving as a liaison with corporate partners and helping instruct the Design Innovation course ME310 in the Mechanical Engineering department We will miss Bob and wish him well on his next adventure which we understand will involve a fair bit of travel and relaxation Loss of Beloved Administrator Last fall our department lost a beloved and dedicated administrator In November 2010 Suvan Gerlach manager of the Stanford AI Lab SAIL was injured in a devastating car accident she tragically passed away about three weeks later Suvan moved from Engineering Research Administration to SAIL in 2008 and quickly became the heart and soul of the lab In addition to her impeccable skills in managing a complex organization involving multiple faculty and many students she was a wonderful human being She was always happy brightening the day of everyone around her She continually looked for ways to make life a little bit better for students faculty and staff Suvan was greatly loved and admired by everyone who knew her and she is sorely missed Education Update There s been a lot happening in the education side of the department at all levels In this newsletter we give an update on how our significantly revised undergraduate curriculum is faring three years after its introduction We also outline a recent overhaul to our MS degree requirements and some welcome changes to the structure of the Ph D program Finally we highlight a course that partners student projects with industrial sponsors New Undergraduate Curriculum 3 Years After As you may recall from previous newsletters we did a major revamping of our undergraduate curriculum in 2008 09 Three years into it we re happy to report that the change continues to be a huge success In its first two years alone we saw an 83 increase in the number of students declaring CS as a major with a leveling in the 3rd year but no sign of a decline CS is now the largest undergraduate major in the School of Engineering by far and in the top four majors university wide This coming year we re further extending the undergraduate curriculum by officially folding the old Computer Systems Engineering program into Computer Science as a Computer Engineering track Such changes help us continue to provide rigorous and flexible options for students to pursue their passion in computing Also noteworthy is that enrollment in introductory computer science classes at Stanford has reached record levels with over 1000 students taking CS106A Programming Methodology this past year Across all of the introductory course options in computing we now estimate that 90 of undergraduates take a CS course sometime during their Stanford career New Masters Curriculum Continuing with the theme of curricular revision this past year we rolled out a significant update of the Masters curriculum Goals of the new program were to provide more flexibility in exploring a variety of CS areas and to promote involvement in research Students can now choose either a single concentration area as before or they can pursue a program with a dual concentration to highlight work spanning multiple subdisciplines At the same time the overall program is more streamlined giving students more elective choices for additional breadth or depth depending on taste and more options for incorporating research as part of a student s program requirements While the new program has only been in effect for a year we ve received uniformly positive feedback with several students reporting that the program s flexibility has allowed them to pursue interdisciplinary work in CS that they otherwise would not have considered Innovations in Ph D Program Our Ph D program has always been low on rules and structure focusing instead on turning our Ph D students into productive independent researchers as quickly as possible For example unlike all of our peer top rated CS graduate programs our Ph D students have no course requirements whatsoever Granted we ve always had a set of comprehensive exams to ensure all Ph D students have basic knowledge of the field a qualifying exam to ensure depth of knowledge in the student s chosen area and capability for original research and of course a dissertation defense at the end Last year we loosened things up even further abolishing the comprehensive exams in favor of a simple breadth requirement often satisfied by a Ph D student s undergraduate coursework Our Ph D students are arriving more prepared than ever before many with a fully loaded undergraduate CS transcript and significant research experience to boot And for those students with a less conventional background I wish we admitted more I was one myself back in the day the new requirement can be satisfied by taking or sitting in on a few classes The other change we made to our Ph D program is in my opinion far more intriguing Instead of asking students to settle on a research area and find an advisor during their first quarter at Stanford we ve introduced a rotation system Students spend each of their first three quarters working with a different faculty member getting to know each of their labs research areas research styles and other students in the group At the end of the year both students and faculty can make an informed decision about the best match In addition students have the opportunity to form significant connections with faculty and students in research groups they don t end up joining a frequent student complaint prior to the rotation system was limited interaction outside of their chosen research group First year graduate student rotations are fairly common in other fields especially in the biological sciences but we re the pioneers in computer science as far as we know Our inaugural rotating class has just completed their first year feedback is overwhelmingly positive so far Student Projects with Industrial Partners In continuing to invigorate our curriculum with relevant new course offerings we just completed our third year offering CS210 a project based course in which Stanford student teams collaborate with global corporations on software challenges During the two quarter sequence student teams work on open ended project themes provided by industrial partners The partners make a substantial commitment to the teams in time and resources as students work closely with them to understand real world needs and develop innovative solutions The teams take their projects all the way from concept to completion which includes defining requirements iterating through ideas and prototypes and ultimately producing a final product Projects span all industries with a focus on applying the latest software approaches and techniques to the problem domains The project teams present their final results at our annual Software Faire as well as to the industrial partners often including the company s senior executives Project collaborators have included AOL BMW Facebook Meebo Microsoft Samsung and Yahoo If you think your company might be interested in sponsoring a CS210 project contact the course instructor Jay Borenstein Admissions Statistics Have you ever wondered how difficult it is to be admitted to CS graduate school at Stanford Here are a few statistics This past year we had 692 applicants to our Ph D program We accepted 71 with about 50 of them taking us up on our offer Now 10 might not seem like terrible odds as compared with say getting into Stanford as an undergraduate 7 admission rate But those 692 applicants were already a somewhat self selected group For our Masters program we had 667 applicants we accepted 123 and 92 of them have taken up our offer What may surprise you is that we do have a graduate program with a nearly 100 accept rate Our special coterminal program where undergraduates apply to extend their stay at Stanford and receive an MS degree along with their BS accepted 88 out of 91 applicants this year That s not to say any Stanford undergraduate will be accepted the admissions criteria are fairly clear so students generally have a good idea whether or not they ll be accepted even before they apply The Job Market in Computer Science is Hot and it s not due to global warming Not only is the weather hot this summer but so is the CS job market The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that Computer Scientist is one of the fastest growing job sectors this coming decade With the high tech economy taking off more students are also considering career choices in computing A recent front page article in the New York Times which prominently quotes our own Prof Mehran Sahami reported on this trend While that article perhaps overplays the significance of the movie The Social Network on students decision making it is nevertheless clear that computing is an area that students are increasingly attracted to As mentioned earlier with respect to enrollment numbers at Stanford we re experiencing that student interest in spades with a dramatic increase in the number of CS majors and 90 of Stanford undergraduates taking at least one CS course New National Research Council Rankings Finally Out Rankings of university programs can play a fairly significant role both externally affecting where students decide to apply and ultimately go and internally affecting how a program is viewed by university administration Undergraduate programs generally aren t ranked down to the level of individual departments but graduate programs are US News World Report puts out a ranking each year It s not taken terribly seriously since it s based primarily on simple surveys although it certainly has an effect US News World Report typically ranks our CS graduate program tied for first with some or all of MIT UC Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon Much more comprehensive and scientific and therefore taken much more seriously are the rankings performed by the National Research Council Until this year the most recent NRC doctoral program ranking was way back in 1995 At the time we were ranked first followed by MIT and then UC Berkeley The next NRC ranking of doctoral programs was launched in 2005 but it was delayed and delayed and further delayed What could they have been doing that took a full five years When the rankings were finally published in September 2010 we found out Complex and mysterious formulas were used and instead of simple rankings rank ranges were published of two different types The rankings contained many surprises including basic errors in data collection mostly corrected in a quick follow up to the first published ranking inconsistencies in data interpretation and factors balanced in ways nobody expected Needless to say there was quite a response to the rankings ranging from outrage on the part of departments expecting to be near the top but nowhere near to glee and boasting from those experiencing the converse And how did we fare Let s just say there were very few complaints emanating from Stanford Engineering as a whole or from our department although we did sympathize with some of our peer departments who seem to have gotten short shrift Our rank range by both measures was 1 2 with the next highest CS department Princeton a significant jump up for them receiving a range of 1 4 There s been plenty of controversy surrounding the rankings especially in computer science Try a web search for NRC doctoral programs or check out the Wikipedia page to find the latest VMWare Founders Professorship in Computer Science As mentioned in last year s newsletter the university granted approval for the CS Department to increase in size by up to ten regular faculty members but we need to raise funds to support the growth Each additional faculty position requires an endowment of 2 5 million to be augmented by School of Engineering funds Our first endowment to support departmental growth was bittersweet a Google funded professorship honoring Prof Rajeev Motwani who passed away in a tragic 2009 accident This year I m pleased to report the second professorship under nothing but happy circumstances Edouard Bugnion Diane Greene and Mendel Rosenblum three of the founders of the VMWare Corporation created the VMware Founders Professorship in Computer Science The new professorship is designated to support faculty in the Department of Computer Science who are known for their past and ongoing contributions to disruptive technologies technologies that fundamentally change the course of computer science science and engineering Prof Marc Levoy has been named to the endowed position Marc s long history of extraordinarily innovative research more than satisfies the criteria set out for the new professorship Distinguished Visitors and Lecturers Under the able leadership of Prof David Dill our Distinguished Lecturer and Visitor program was in its second year and is going strong For the 2010 11 academic year we hosted George Varghese as a Distinguished Visitor George was on sabbatical from his faculty position UC San Diego Although George is widely known for his many years of research contributions in computer networking he spent much of his time at Stanford branching out to apply computer science abstractions to biological problems His enthusiasm was infectious and he educated many of us about biological problems that can benefit from computer science techniques We hosted three Distinguished Lecturers this year Jeff Dean from Google Jon Kleinberg from Cornell and Barbara Liskov from MIT All three talks were highly engaging and complimented each other perfectly we hope to attract equally exciting speakers next year Research Activities As always a tremendous amount of exciting research is going on in the department For this newsletter I decided to feature research projects led by some of our younger faculty All of our assistant professors are doing truly innovative work please enjoy these three samples and visit the CS Department website to learn about ongoing research across the entire field New Languages for Data Visualization The increasing scale and availability of digital data presents an unprecedented opportunity to inform public policy scientific discovery business strategy and even our personal lives But for such data to prove valuable we must be able to make sense of it In concert with data management systems and statistical algorithms analysis requires contextualized human judgments regarding the meaning and significance of the patterns discovered in data By leveraging the remarkable capabilities of human visual perception visualization provides a powerful means of understanding data However creating effective visualizations for data exploration and communication can be difficult and time consuming To accelerate the design of custom visualizations Ph D student Michael Bostock and his advisor Prof Jeffrey Heer are developing declarative domain specific languages for data visualization Their Protovis language provides a grammar for authoring expressive visualizations by mapping data to the visual properties of graphical primitives Protovis statements serve as functional style sheets for data requiring only limited programming ability The primary implementation in JavaScript provides interactive browser native visualizations using HTML5 Subsequent work implementing the Protovis model in Java leverages the declarative nature of the language to optimize processing leading to 20x scalability improvements over existing information visualization frameworks Protovis developers already number in the tens of thousands including researchers companies and journalists e g The Washington Post Protovis also ships as part of Mozilla Thunderbird to enable visualizations of email Building on the Protovis approach Mike and Jeff are now developing a new system Data Driven Documents D3 Rather than map data to a specialized vocabulary of graphical marks D3 binds data directly to elements of a web page Using D3 designers can generate data driven text and graphics to create rich interactive data displays Full Duplex Radios Radios today cannot receive and transmit simultaneously on the same frequency The reason is simple a radio s own transmission is millions to billions times louder than something it might hear from another radio Trying to receive while transmitting is like trying to hear a whisper while shouting This limitation is a basic assumption of wireless systems today A recent breakthrough by Profs Sachin Katti andPhilip Levis invalidates this assumption Their research groups have developed the first full duplex radios that can send and receive on the same frequency simultaneously Doing so immediately doubles the possible data capacity of the network and has many other advantages that will likely lead to even faster and more efficient networks in the future For example full duplex can greatly improve mobile wireless coverage indoors a major problem in rural and dense urban areas It does so by enabling a repeater that simultaneously hears a quiet signal from a distant phone base station and repeats it at a higher power for nearby mobile phones The basic insight behind full duplex is that the radio already knows what its transmitted signal is so a specially designed circuit can filter that signal out from its receiver In essence the radio subtracts its transmitted signal from what it hears and feeds the result to its receiver The idea is simple but there are numerous challenges stemming from the fact that these are analog signals not digital values For example circuitry can distort or corrupt the signals Prof Katti and Levis research groups have been able to overcome these challenges well enough to demonstrate a full duplex Wi Fi access point and they are working towards other wireless technologies Please visit their Full Duplex website for more information Mind Reading of Brain Activities by Computers Since the dawn of human civilization an eternal scientific quest has been to understand the workings of the brain the most powerful computing machine ever known Prof Fei Fei Li and her group have been focusing their studies on one of the most complex and intricate systems of the brain the visual system After looking at a photograph for only a fraction of a second a human can give rich descriptions about the layout of the scene and all of the objects in it The mechanisms our brain uses to perform this feat are still a mystery and even the fastest supercomputers are not nearly as good at scene understanding as the average person Prof Li s group is using cutting edge brain scanning techniques to study the brain activity of human subjects performing visual tasks Then they apply advanced statistical and machine learning tools to ask questions such as What brain areas are responsible for scene perception and how are they connected How is visual information represented in the brain Which types of visual tasks require attention and which can be performed subconsciously This combination of advanced neuroscience imaging and computational methods is termed mind reading in the popular press Here are a few examples of Prof Li s results Her group discovered a brain area near the hippocampus involved in categorizing complex scene classes e g kitchen highway urban beach One of the group s recent studies showed that line drawings of scenes are represented in the same way photographs demonstrating the power of the visual system to generate abstract descriptions of the world around us The group also pioneered a new method for mapping connections between brain areas using information theory showing that it is possible to predict the type of scene a subject is viewing e g a beach or a forest by looking only at the subject s brain activity Working at the intersection of neuroscience psychology and computer science Prof Li s interdisciplinary research is helping to unravel the complex brain activity that occurs every time we open our eyes Faculty and Staff Awards Once again our faculty have garnered a wealth of major awards Don Knuth BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award Daphne Koller NationaI Academy of Engineering Jure Leskovec Microsoft Faculty Fellow Fei Fei Li Sloan Fellowship Nick McKeown National Academy of Engineering Ken Salisbury IEEE Inaba Technical Award for Innovation Leading to Production Sebastian Thrun IEEE

Company a runner up as The smartest academic person in tech by CNN Money magazine and his driverless car project at Google was named one of Time magazine s 50 best inventions of 2010 It s certainly a testament to the breadth and depth of our faculty that we find them being named as Sloan Fellows inducted into the National Academy and gracing numerous top N lists in the popular business press all in the same year A particularly gratifying award this year went to Peche Turner who has been the department manager since 1996 Peche is an extraordinary individual with a huge impact on the smooth functioning of Stanford CS With an onslaught of enthusiastic nominations from across the department Peche was named one of the 2011 winners of the university wide Amy J Blue award the highest honor the university has for staff members The award couldn t have gone to a more deserving individual I encourage you to read the Stanford News article about Peche to gain some appreciation for all that she brings to our department Student News Our students continue to do wonderful work and receive a variety of accolades School Wide Academic Honors This year David Tobin was recognized as the Ford Scholar in the School of Engineering an award given annually to the undergraduate student with the highest GPA across the entire school Congratulations David Undergraduate Research Emily Stark won the Wegbreit Prize for Best CS Undergraduate Honors Thesis as well as a university level Firestone Medal for Excellence in Undergraduate Research Emily s thesis entitled The Case for Prefetching and Prevalidating TLS Server Certificates was advised by Prof Dan Boneh Ph D Research Nicolas Lambert received the department s Arthur Samuel Award for outstanding Ph D thesis Nicolas s thesis titled

is needed to come up with what s happened over the past year in the CS department most everyone would agree the year s distinguishing features were StanfordNYC and Online Education I ll discuss both of these very interesting developments one already in the past and the other going strong later in the newsletter although it s not possible to give either of them the coverage they deserve without going on for pages I ll also highlight our exciting new faculty hires record breaking enrollments and majors a special year on CS theory our usual array of faculty staff and student awards and a tiny glimpse into our plethora of research activities I doubt many of you are counting but this marks my third newsletter I had intended it to be my last although my time as CS department chair falls a bit short of the departmental average it s already been longer than the three year rotation I signed up for But given the turmoil of the past year reminder StanfordNYC and Online Education my arm was twisted to stick it out another year or two for continuity So for better or worse you ll be hearing from me again next summer Please enjoy the many departmental highlights of the 2011 12 academic year New Faculty Once again we were able to snag two of the year s most talented CS PhDs to join our faculty In 2013 Michael Bernstein and Greg Valiant will become Stanford CS assistant professors Michael Bernstein received his Ph D from MIT where he has already made prominent contributions to the new and exciting field of crowdsourcing within the broader areas of social computing and human computer interaction Stanford is a bit of a homecoming for Michael who graduated from Stanford with a symbolic systems major before heading to MIT for graduate school It s even more of a homecoming for Michael s wife Adi Greif who not only was a Stanford undergraduate but grew up on the Stanford campus as a faculty child Michael is spending his first year back in the Bay Area as a post doc at Facebook before moving into the Gates Building in January Gregory Valiant is finishing up his Ph D at UC Berkeley our traditional cross bay rival but also the source of many of our faculty Hiring our own PhDs directly to the faculty is strongly frowned upon due to inbreeding so it s not surprising that most of our faculty come from other top departments like Berkeley and MIT Greg works in computer science theory with a broad portfolio of results in algorithms learning applied probability and statistics Greg will spend a year as a post doc at the Microsoft Cambridge research lab before joining us in the fall of 2013 Incidentally lest you wonder if there s a relationship Greg s father Leslie not long ago won ACM s Turing Award widely considered the Nobel Prize of Computer Science And Greg s brother Paul will be joining the CS faculty at Brown University Quite a family Faculty Knowledge Quiz Michael Bernstein is our third faculty member to have participated in the much loved CS section leader program as an undergraduate Do you know who the other two are Email your answer to smorze stanford edu if it s correct we ll include your name in next year s newsletter CS Popularity among Undergraduates Reaches Record Levels This was a record breaking year for CS enrollments on many fronts First we set a new all time high for the number of undergraduates choosing to major in CS with 246 students declaring their CS major this past year alone That s more than 40 higher than the previous record of 171 CS declarations in 2000 01 at the height of the dot com bubble and double the number of annual declarations from just a few years ago e g 123 CS declarations 2008 09 As a result CS has become for the first time ever the largest undergraduate major at Stanford In addition to record numbers of CS majors we are also seeing large numbers of students from across the university choosing to take CS courses More than 1 500 students took the introductory programming course CS106A this past academic year an increase of more than a 25 from 2010 11 which was the previous record Also the CS department taught a total of nearly 60 000 class units last year the largest number of units taught by any department at Stanford Currently over 90 of all Stanford undergraduates take at least one CS class before graduating and we re seeing increasing numbers of graduate students from other fields taking CS classes as well Needless to say accommodating all of these students in our classes poses some logistical challenges but the level of interest in CS across the student body is exciting and invigorating StanfordNYC In July 2011 mayor Michael Bloomberg announced a university competition to open a world class campus for engineering and applied sciences in New York City Despite peer institutions having set up shop in locales ranging from Singapore to Qatar Stanford long resisted overtures to create a satellite campus abroad However a NYC campus held more appeal There s no language or cultural barrier though some might argue there s a pretty big cultural divide between California and New York no insurmountable time difference and NYC has the largest concentration of Stanford alums outside of the Bay Area After a long series of discussions at all levels of the university and a lot of hard work in October 2011 Stanford submitted a 100 page proposal for StanfordNYC a 2 5 billion 1 9 million square foot campus to be developed on Roosevelt Island over 30 years The campus would have an eventual faculty of more than 200 and an eventual graduate student body of more than 2 000 The initial focus of the campus would be on information technology and entrepreneurship something we at Stanford especially in the CS department are certainly experts in Needless to say the new campus would have a tremendous impact on the CS department demanding rapid growth as well as exciting innovations in distance learning and new opportunities for collaborative research It was widely acknowledged that Stanford was one of leading contenders to be awarded the campus Extensive discussions between Stanford and NYC took place during November and early December 2011 During the discussions Stanford was taken by surprise by a number of logistics and restrictions that were not part of the original announcement Eventually Stanford came to realize the project would not be the partnership with the city that was originally envisioned and we withdrew our proposal There was of course a significant amount of disappointment after so much work had been done and so much excitement generated But admittedly there was some relief as well the campus would have changed the course of the CS department considerably and we think we re already doing pretty well as we are Shortly after Stanford s withdrawal the NYC campus was awarded to a collaborative proposal between Cornell University and Israel s Technion Please visit the StanfordNYC page if you re interested in learning more Online Education Initiatives Over the past few years a number of CS faculty started thinking about shaking up the way we teach You might remember from our 2010 newsletter see Using Technology to Enable Human Human Interaction in the Classroom that Prof Daphne Koller was promoting the idea of a flipped classroom where students watch prerecorded video lectures on their own time to learn the core material The videos are delivered in short topic specific chunks with embedded quizzes to check basic understanding Classroom time is devoted to interactive exercises and other engaging activities that reinforce and expand the core material In the summer of 2011 Prof Sebastian Thrun surprised everyone by deciding that not only would he use the flipped classroom approach for his fall offering of CS221 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence but he would make the lecture videos available for free to the public and augment them with automatically checked exercises and a public discussion forum Prof Andrew Ng and yours truly had also been planning to try the flipped classroom in our fall courses CS229 Machine Learning and CS145 Introduction to Databases so we joined Sebastian in making our courses available to the world The reception was unprecedented Within just a few weeks literally hundreds of thousands of students had signed up for the three courses Fast forwarding to the end of fall quarter tens of thousands of students from around the world had completed one or more of the courses with a huge outpouring of gratitude and excitement Profs Thrun Ng and I had thrown ourselves into our projects creating and perfecting course materials and exercises while watching with wonder as the discussion forums hummed with activity It turns out there s no need for teaching assistants when you have social networking among thousands of eager students On the Stanford front although there were some mixed reactions to the new format the key to success was improved self learning together with good use of the new found classroom time In my database course there was nearly unanimous agreement that the purpose made lecture videos with quizzes and the extensive automated exercises were enjoyable and provided an effective way to learn the basic material Add on the interactive classroom activities hand graded challenge problems a programming project and conventional exams and the complete package sat very well with the Stanford students As concrete evidence my course evaluation scores saw a measurable uptick it s hard to argue with that What s happened since last fall can only be described as scary and wonderful chaos Two start up companies were born from the Stanford efforts Coursera founded by Profs Koller and Ng is building a platform that can deliver a wide variety of courses developed by multiple universities while Udacity founded by Prof Thrun is developing its own curriculum to educate budding software engineers MIT and Harvard jointly announced edX reportedly many other universities are thinking very seriously about how or whether they should join the fray Press coverage has been widespread Practically every gathering of faculty formal or informal within Stanford or beyond ends up with a long discussion of online education what it means for us now and what it means in the long run President Hennessy took a sabbatical for a few months this spring guess what he reports spending his time thinking about He describes a tsunami coming to education one that we can either surf or be drowned by This is Stanford we created the initial wave and we ll be riding the tsunami Meanwhile back in the CS department about a dozen more courses have been converted to a flipped classroom a public offering or both It s a lot of work for the faculty but every instructor is simply jazzed by the ability to make substantial improvements in his or her Stanford course while at the same reaching thousands of students around the world At some point the chaos will settle and we ll see where these developments are headed for the long term Our own Prof John Mitchellhas been named Vice Provost for Online Learning a post that includes chairing a high powered university level committee to think seriously about the many issues involved and where Stanford should head Meanwhile in true Stanford style the plan is to encourage experimentation across platforms disciplines and audiences You can follow Stanford s wide variety of online education activities some new and many long standing on the website Online Learning at Stanford One thing you can count on CS faculty will be at the heart of Stanford s fast moving efforts to use new technology to improve on campus and off campus education Special Year on Theoretical Computer Science The theory group celebrated a number of recent faculty hires Prof Luca Trevisan Prof Ryan Williams and now Greg Valiant with a Special Year on Theoretical Computer Science which featured important visitors as well as seminars workshops and a new colloquium series Princeton professor Bob Tarjan the CS department s Distinguished Visitor for the year ran a seminar on data structures and collaborated with Prof Ashish Goel from Stanford s MS E department on new results for the classical Union Find data structure Harvard professor Salil Vadhan and his Ph D students also visited the department working with Prof Trevisan and his group on problems in computational complexity and cryptography Prof Tim Roughgarden organized an algorithms workshop with the theme Beyond Worst Case Analysis Profs Roughgarden and Trevisan initiated the Rajeev Motwani Distinguished Lecture Series an ongoing quarterly series of colloquia in theoretical computer science aimed at a broad audience All workshop and colloquium talks are archived on YouTube While the Special Year has come to a close the theory group continues to be a hotbed of activity This coming year Stanford will host two of the premier annual conferences in theoretical computer science the ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing and the IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity Prof Trevisan will run a workshop on graph partitioning algorithms random walks and expander graphs three topics that have significant mathematical connections but are studied by largely distinct communities Prof Goel and Prof Amin Saberi also from the MS E department will organize a workshop on issues at the intersection of social networks and theoretical computer science an area that is also well represented in the long standing RAIN Research on Algorithms and Incentives in Networks seminar run jointly by CS and MS E Research Activities As always a tremendous amount of exciting research is going on in the department Please enjoy these four samples representing a diverse cross section of topics and research styles and visit the CS Department website to learn about our ongoing research across the entire field The MobiSocial Project Spring 2011 saw the creation of the new MobiSocial Computing Laboratory directed by Prof Monica Lam A primary goal of the MobiSocial project is to create open technologies for social networking and data ownership that free users from being locked into proprietary solutions In just over a year the lab has already developed a new social network called Musubi which allows groups of phone users to share text pictures games and most importantly apps in real time all without intermediation Data is shared over phones with the help of identity based encryption and backed up to users choice of storage Musubi has recently been released on the Android Play Store and the iPhone version is forthcoming With the help of a few freshmen and local high school students Musubi is also emerging as a promising research platform to attract pre college students especially girls into computer science The MobiSocial Lab operates in part as an industry affiliates program currently consisting of five partners AVG Google ING Direct part of Capital One Nokia and Sony Ericsson Given what s come out of the new lab in just one short year stay tuned for exciting further developments Data Driven 3D Modeling The ability to easily create detailed synthetic models of three dimensional objects and environments would have significant applications in entertainment education and telecommunication Unfortunately creating three dimensional models of complex objects is notoriously difficult and time consuming Making the creation of three dimensional content more accessible is one of the biggest challenges in computer graphics research Over the past few years Prof Vladlen Koltun and his group have developed a new generation of 3D modeling tools that allow even novices to create detailed models of complex objects The key idea is to use machine learning to construct representations of geometric and structural properties of objects from different families such as buildings airplanes or chairs These representations are used to assist the modeling process They are capable of generating complete objects from these categories in response to high level specifications and can fill in geometric details that previously required painstaking sculpting Prof Koltun s group has demonstrated that data driven tools support rapid modeling of custom buildings furniture vehicles aircraft ships animals and other types of complex objects See the project page for more information Web Privacy and Third Party TrackingProf John Mitchell has been studying third party tracking on the web together with his Ph D student Jonathan Mayer who has the unusual distinction of pursuing jointly a CS Ph D and Law degree When you visit a web site that contains an advertisement the advertisement is requested by your browser based on commands provided by the site you visited These commands may trigger a series of requests to third party sites possibly passing any information known to the first party site Since third party advertisers learn your network address and other information about you each time they serve an ad they can correlate data associated with different requests originating from different first party sites you visit As a result an advertiser can learn for example that you visited several different shopping sites a health site and a social network site possibly correlating information about what you looked at or bought at each one Prof Mitchell and his student designed a method for opting out of third party tracking called Do Not Track which is now supported in all major browsers Over this past year the group also developed a tool called Fourth Party which can be used to track third party tracking Fourth Party is an instrumented browser that records events that occur when a web site is visited and stores them in a database Using Fourth Party a number of sites have been found to violate their apparent privacy promises to users or to use unusually invasive tracking techniques such as history stealing Data collected using Fourth Party has led to a number of actions against tracking companies by the Federal Trade Commission and a number of prominent articles in major news outlets Architectural Support for Snapshot Isolation and Atomic Update The long running quest for abstractions and mechanisms that facilitate the development of highly concurrent and highly available systems has gained importance with the growing use of multi core systems and the expectation of 24x7 system availability The atomic transaction is being used extensively to this end in both database and distributed systems The snapshot isolation model of transactions is being favored because it avoids the need to detect read write conflicts With the memory system being the performance bottleneck for many applications an important research question being addressed by Prof David Cheriton and his group is whether there is a compelling case for architectural support in the memory system for snapshot isolation based transactions Recent innovations provide a memory controller with an extra level of indirection to physical memory allowing deduplication of memory at cache line granularity for virtual machine environments saving on DRAM Prof Cheriton s group uses this technology to make creating a snapshot of state far less expensive it can also be used to atomically update on transaction commit The direction shows promise in supporting highly concurrent multi core applications without locking as well as providing hardware support for in memory databases using consistent read semantics Because the shared memory lines are immutable this approach also reduces the coherency memory traffic between processor cores a key issue with scaling performance The same deduplicating memory architecture is being tried on sparse matrix computation where again memory access overhead dominates as the performance bottleneck With benefits across several application domains Prof Cheriton believes this approach makes a compelling case for a major redesign of the 70 year old Von Neumann memory model Faculty and Staff Awards It s been an especially good year for major faculty awards Leo Guibas IEEE Fellow Jeff Heer Sloan Fellowship John Hennessy IEEE Medal of Honor Yes John is the university president but he remains a member of the CS faculty and we re proud of it Scott Klemmer Katayanagi Prize for Emerging Leadership Don Knuth IET Faraday Medal Don Knuth again Elected to American Philosophical Society Jean Claude Latombe IEEE

the Robert and Ruth Halperin University Fellow in Undergraduate Education and Dan Boneh received the Dean s Ishii Award for Industry Education Innovation When we hired Keith Schwarz as a lecturer a year ago we knew he was an amazing teacher as a Stanford CS undergraduate and coterminal student he created and taught courses that quickly became among the most highly rated in the department It didn t take long for his talents to be recognized on an even broader scale Keith is the 2012 recipient of the Tau Beta Pi Excellence in Teaching Award given to just one individual across the entire school of engineering It s unusual for this award to go to a lecturer and nearly unheard of for someone to receive it after just one year of full time teaching Keith is an educator of the very highest caliber we re extremely fortunate to have him On the staff side we were thrilled that our beloved and extraordinarily competent student services specialist Meredith Hutchin won the School of Engineering s Kay Bradley Award for Outstanding Service to Students Meredith indeed does an outstanding job with a wide variety of student related tasks but even more importantly she brings true compassion and a can do attitude to student issues be they large or small Even with double the number of students from just a few years ago and therefore double the number of student issues Meredith solves them and does it with a smile It s staff like Meredith that make the CS department such a happy home for so many Student News Our students continue to do amazing things and garner wide recognition for it School Wide Academic Honors Frank Li was named the Ford Scholar in the School of Engineering an award given annually to the undergraduate student with the highest GPA across the entire engineering school Well done Frank Frank is the third Ford Scholar in a row to hail from the CS Department Previous winners were David Tobin in 2011 and Keith Schwarz now a CS Lecturer in 2010 Undergraduate Research Pang Wei Koh won not one but three awards with his undergraduate honors thesis Indentifying Genetic Drivers of Cancer Morphology advised by Prof Daphne Koller Departmentally Pang Wei won the Wegbreit Prize for Best CS Undergraduate Honors Thesis He also won one of 28 university wide Firestone Medals for Excellence in Undergraduate Research His crown jewel was receiving the Kennedy Thesis Prize for the best honors thesis across all of the applied sciences and engineering Congratulations Pang Wei Graduate Research The Arthur Samuel Award for outstanding CS Ph D thesis

Thrun Teaching Awards Our students did such an impressive job in support of teaching this year that two of them Katherine Breeden and David Cummings received the department s George Forsythe Memorial Award for Excellence in Student Teaching Katherine was recognized for her work as an outstanding Teaching Assistant for CS148 Introduction to Computer Graphics and Imaging with many students gushing about her unusual talent at promoting learning and enthusiasm for the material David was commended for helping to develop the public version of CS145 Introduction to Databases see Online Education Initiatives above in which over 60 000 students enrolled David did an equally stellar job supporting the 140 Stanford students in the course ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest Stanford once again did quite well in the ACM ICPC with the team of John Pardon Nick Wu and Chenguang Zhu winning first place in the Pacific Northwest Regional Contest besting strong teams from the University of British Columbia University of Washington and of course our cross bay rival UC Berkeley John Nick and Chenguang then advanced to the World Finals in Warsaw Poland where they placed a respectable 13th ahead of both Carnegie Mellon and MIT Recognition from Bill Clinton We re excited to report that Code the Change a student organization spearheaded by CS student Sam King to help computer scientists use their skills for social change was recognized by former President Bill Clinton at the 2012 Clinton Global Initiative University Keep up the great work Sam Distinguished Visitors and Lecturers Our distinguished visitor and lecture program finishing up a third year since its revival continues to thrive thanks to excellent oversight by Prof David Dill For the 2011 12 academic year we hosted Bob Tarjan as a Distinguished Visitor A Stanford Ph D alum Tarjan is bicoastally distinguished his permanent position is as Distinguished University Professor of Computer Science at Princeton As a preeminent theorist Tarjan s visit was timed to coincide with the Special Year on Theory described earlier in the newsletter We hosted three Distinguished Lecturers this year Shree Nayar from Columbia Stefan Savage from UC San Diego and Christos Papadimitriou from UC Berkeley The three talks represented three very different areas computational photography internet security and theory of computation with engaging presentations on timely and fun topics within each one Computer Forum News Times have never been busier at the Computer Forum which for 40 years has been the prime facilitator of connections between industry and Stanford s CS and EE Departments Companies join the Computer Forum to get involved with research recruiting or both This past year has seen membership reach a record high of 108 companies At the peak of the dot com boom around the year 2000 we had 82 members between then and now we dipped as low as 59 Our hunch is that recruiting is the biggest allure for companies these days given the sizzling hiring climate for Stanford CS graduates see The Job Market in Computer Science is Hot in last year s newsletter We had a record breaking 70 companies participating in our two major career fairs and we hosted 180 information sessions where companies give presentations to students often accompanied by free pizza and corporate swag We hosted over 250 interviews and organized several field trips for students to visit local companies Unfortunately none of our foreign companies currently hailing from Brazil China Hong Kong Japan Korea and Saudi Arabia have yet offered to sponsor field trips On the research side the spring Annual Meeting together with focused workshops surrounding the main meeting always draws hundreds of participants This year s featured topics were on line education machine learning computer security and mobile social applications We re hosting 18 visiting scholars member company employees who spend a year in a Stanford research group Computer Forum membership fees are used in a variety of ways to support the CS and EE departments they support incoming graduate students research seminars and student groups like our ACM student chapter WICS Women in Computer Science and WEE Women in Electrical Engineering With increased membership the Forum has also been able to support our annual undergraduate student project fair popular with company representatives not to mention venture capitalists and provide funds for students to attend the always inspiring Grace Hopper Conference The Computer Forum is a win win enterprise for companies and Stanford alike If your company is not yet a member please consider joining Until the next newsletter have a terrific year Jennifer Widom Fletcher Jones Professor Chair

t been quite as tumultuous as the previous one when consideration of a New York City campus and rapid fire developments in online education kept all of us on our toes and occasionally awake at night On the other hand it s not as if we ve been sitting around with nothing to do CS106A became so popular the fire marshal showed up to shoo students from the aisles the number of CS majors now dwarfs every other major on campus and our growing computer clusters in the basement of the Gates building regularly blow out the electricity We re bursting at the seams but also reveling in our success The past several years have been especially fruitful ones in terms of faculty hiring Last year alone garnered four new professors covering a spectrum of computer science computational biology data management computer vision and theory Our new faculty members are introduced below This newsletter also describes several successful new programs supporting women in CS from high school to PhD and describes a variety of projects where CS students have put their talents to work in aid of society As usual our faculty staff and students have gathered a large number of awards and honors A few research synopses and an update on online education round out the newsletter Please enjoy the many departmental highlights of the 2012 13 academic year New Faculty and Lecturers We re very excited to have four new faculty joining the department which might just be a record for a single year They cover a wide swath of research areas and despite their junior status already bring with them an unusual wealth of research experience Ron Dror received his Ph D from MIT in 2002 and since then has been working at D E Shaw Research DESRES was founded by Stanford CS Ph D alum David Shaw but should not be confused with the well known D E Shaw investment firm DESRES is a thriving research lab in the area of computational biochemistry Ron was DESRES first hire and he has been serving in a leadership role throughout his time at the lab Ron is excited to move to the academic environment and ramp up his own research program in computation and biology We re particularly excited that Ron is jointly appointed between Computer Science and the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering ICME Although CS and ICME have a long history of collaborations Ron will further strengthen those important ties Christopher R received his Ph D from the University of Washington in 2009 and he joins us after four years on the faculty at the University of Wisconsin Chris sums up his already voluminous body of work in databases machine learning and Big Data in general along with his plans for the future with a simple statement on his web page I believe that the future of computing is in data management As a database researcher myself I m not going to argue In addition to his fundamental theoretical and practical work Chris has fostered a number of interesting interdisciplinary collaborations including a project whose code is deployed at the South Pole as part of the IceCube Neutrino Detector We can t wait to see what Chris does at Stanford Silvio Savarese received his Ph D from CalTech in 2005 spent three years as a Beckman Institute Fellow at the University of Illinois then joined the EECS faculty at the University of Michigan before moving to Stanford this fall Silvio brings strength and experience in the very important area of computer vision Silvio s work specifically focuses on analyzing and modeling visual scenes from static images and video sequences with the goal of enabling machines to perform a variety of real world visual tasks In his hiring talk Silvio showed a short video of his very young son crawling around their home effortlessly grabbing and manipulating a variety of objects His research objective is to help computers become as adept as young Leo Virginia Vassilevska Williams received her Ph D from Carnegie Mellon in 2008 Since then she has been a post doc at the Institute for Advanced Study Princeton and UC Berkeley and a research scientist jointly appointed between UC Berkeley and Stanford Virginia is a theorist the latest in a recent spate of hiring that has quickly catapulted our theory group from a modest few but excellent faculty to one of the strongest groups anywhere Virginia is particularly well known for a dramatic result showing the first improvement in 25 years to the known complexity upper bound for matrix multiplication It may not appear dramatic that the improvement comes in the form of an exponent reduced from 2 376 to 2 373 but if you think about how often matrices are multiplied even a tiny improvement quickly adds up In her research scientist position Virginia has already been conducting exciting research with Stanford students and professors we re thrilled to have her join the regular faculty In addition to four new faculty to meet the rapidly increasing demand for CS courses more on this topic shortly we re adding two new Lecturers to our excellent staff Cynthia Lee joins us from UC San Diego where she received her CS Ph D in 2009 and has been a Lecturer in the Computer Science and Engineering department since 2007 Joining Stanford is a homecoming for Cynthia who grew up in the Bay Area Marty Stepp joins us from the University of Washington where he has been a Lecturer and Senior Lecturer in the Computer Science and Engineering Department since 2006 Marty is an author of three CS textbooks including one of the leading introductory Java textbooks currently available We re very excited to have Cynthia and Marty adding further strength to our world renowned Computer Science Education program Quiz follow up Last year s newsletter mentioned that new faculty member Michael Bernstein became our third professor to have participated in the much loved CS section leader program as an undergraduate and asked if anyone knew who the other two are Responses were shall we say slim but for completeness the answer is Tim Roughgarden and Mehran Sahami Tenure and Retirement I m pleased to announce that Prof Phil Levis and Prof Fei Fei Li have been promoted to Associate Professor with tenure We re very excited to enjoy Phil and Fei Fei s considerable contributions to the research and teaching missions of the department for many years to come Meanwhile Prof Terry Winograd has retired his regular faculty position although as with many Emeritus faculty Terry continues to stay closely involved with the department Throughout his career Terry s research and teaching have been truly at the vanguard of major advances from artificial intelligence to social computing ubiquitous computing and design thinking Terry s Ph D thesis was a landmark in natural language processing Terry went on to make seminal contributions to human computer interaction HCI and social computing through his books Understanding Computers and Cognition and Bringing Design to Software In 1990 Terry founded Stanford s program on People Computers and Design one of the world s first and most visible academic HCI programs The program s Web broadcast seminar has run nonstop for 23 years Terry s Interactive Workspaces project was an early and ambitious effort exploring computing beyond the desktop Terry has educated an entire generation of computer scientists including many successful entrepreneurs e g CEO Larry Page and academics e g Cornell s Francois Guimbretiere you can watch their toasts to Terry at the HCI group s 20th anniversary celebration Recently Terry was one of the founding faculty of the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford better known as the d school teaching design thinking to students campus wide Last but not least with his curly gray locks and shining intellect Terry bears a striking resemblance to Albert Einstein yielding delighted photograph requests from new freshmen to proud parents at graduation CS Popularity Shows Sharp Increases for Fifth Year in a Row This is the fifth year in a row with significant increases in both CS major declarations and CS course enrollments Although I m beginning to sound like a broken record hmm does the iPod generation even use that phrase we set another all time high for the number of undergraduates choosing to major in CS 261 students declared CS as their major this past year alone Computer Science remains the most popular undergraduate major at Stanford now a whopping 50 larger than the second most popular major Human Biology In addition to record numbers of CS majors the number of students from across the university choosing to take at least one CS courses is unprecedented More than 2000 students took one of the entry level programming courses this past academic year the vast majority enrolling in CS106A a number that s far higher than the size of each year s freshman class How can that be you ask In addition to nearly all Stanford undergraduates opting to take at least one CS class quite a few graduate students in other fields are taking advantage of their time at Stanford to learn about CS as well Classrooms of several hundred students are becoming commonplace in CS We spend lots of time sharing techniques for managing and teaching such large classes effectively It s a continuing challenge but at the same time it s hard to complain about the immense popularity of our department Women in Computer Science While the percentage of women CS majors may seem discouragingly low we re actually well above the national average and we re especially pleased that our percentage is rising steadily In 2012 18 of our BS degrees were awarded to women against a national average of 13 and this year we re up to 23 Of course we still have some distance to go CS students and faculty have launched a variety of programs to encourage women at all levels to embrace Computer Science varying from one day boot camps exposing high school girls to programming for the first time to research exchanges for PhD students Some of our programs have gained national visibility Here s a sampler she When two of our undergraduates came up with the name she while brainstorming a possible day long event around women in computing the name itself was so clever the event had to go forward It was a huge success and she has transformed from an event into a movement Described as a Stanford based community for innovative women in technology with the goal of inspiring women to empower computer science a widely acclaimed documentary video has been produced and more events are planned The video was released publicly this summer Find the video and lots more information on the she website Girls Teaching Girls to Code Empirical studies show clearly that encouraging women students to embrace computer science or any STEM field for that matter is most effective if it occurs well before college Several of our undergraduates developed a program where in one fun filled tuition free Saturday Stanford CS students teach Bay Area high school girls to code The 2013 event quickly reached capacity of 120 high school girls and 25 mentors with an equal number on the waiting list The organizers have another big event planned for 2014 with mini events to keep the momentum going in the meanwhile For more information and to join the mailing list visit the Girls Teaching Girls website Girls Gone Geek For those Bay Area high school girls ready to make a bigger time investment in computer science thanks to an anonymous donor we launched our inaugural Girls Gone Geek two week summer programming workshop Organized by Prof Steve Cooper the workshop is underway at the time of this newsletter writing and appears on track to be a great success More information here Berkeley Stanford Research Meetup Finally for women who have fully embraced computer science and are getting involved in research CS and EE students at Stanford and Berkeley organized a joint research meetup to share their experiences and their research in a supportive and fun environment The 2013 event was held across the bay so next year Stanford is on tap to host Photos and other information from the event can be found on the Research Meetup website CS for Social Good While many of our students are on a direct trajectory towards engineering positions at software companies and frankly the market has never been hotter for these students there s a healthy cohort taking a different path students putting their technical skills to work in direct aid to society Here are just two examples on opposite ends of the globe As their classmates danced away at Stanford s signature all night dance marathon to raise money in support of international health CS students huddled at an adjacent all night code jam producing software for social causes One team of coders worked on a system for modernizing and streamlining administration of the foster care process another team worked on a platform to help grassroots organizations in Africa create websites and collaborate with one another several other projects were underway The dance marathon code jams are organized by Code the Change an organization started by Stanford students whose mission is to help computer scientists use their skills for social change and to make social change an integral part of the computer science culture Our friends across the bay at Cal have followed our lead recently starting their own Code the Change chapter Two CS majors recently traveled with a team of four Stanford students to Ethiopia with the goal of improving conditions in the large refugee camps that turn into de facto cities overnight Our CS students worked directly in the camps designing registration systems and communication networks to vastly improve day to day life You can read more about the students and their experiences in a fascinating article that appeared in the Stanford Report Stanford CS students work with UN on innovation technology for refugees The Latest in Online Education There s no hiding the fact that online education initiatives have taken the world by storm with near daily articles in major newspapers and just about every institution of higher learning taking careful stock of the opportunities challenges and to be honest threats afforded by the extremely rapid developments And there s no denying that the genesis of the storm was right here in the Stanford Computer Science Department As described in last year s newsletter things actually got started several years ago with CS department experiments in both course platform software and flipped classroom teaching Next came the fateful fall of 2011 when Stanford CS delivered the first set of what s since become known as MOOCs Massive Open Online Courses full length full featured courses offered to anyone with an internet connection for free Hundreds of thousands of students enrolled in those three inaugural MOOCs with tens of thousands completing them Two startups were launched from our department and one more from Stanford s Management Science and Engineering department many more MOOCs have been deployed and Stanford named CS faculty member John Mitchell as Vice Provost for Online Learning to oversee initiatives both within campus and beyond One of those initiatives is to support data driven research in online education under the auspices of the new Lytics Lab Some interesting advances in this area have already been made by CS faculty and students see the Codewebs project under Research Activities below It s exciting times in online education with the future still anyone s guess To keep abreast of Stanford s many online education activities in the Computer Science department and university wide please visit the Stanford Online website Research Activities As always a tremendous amount of exciting research is going on in the department Please enjoy these four samples representing a diverse cross section of topics and research styles and visit the CS Department website to learn about our ongoing research across the entire field CodeWebs Providing Complex and Informative Feedback in Programming MOOCs Prof Leonidas Guibas together with postdoctoral researcher Jonathan Huang and graduate students Chris Piech and Andy Nguyen have been studying in their CodeWebs project how to provide individualized feedback to tens of thousands of students taking massive programming courses on line The work is predicated on two simple ideas 1 When the solution space to a programming assignment is densely sampled by the massive student population assignments can be meaningfully linked into a network connecting highly related solutions Such a network provides paths for transporting annotations comments and corrections from one solution to another 2 The majority of erroneous solutions fall into a small number of clusters that are made evident by the network Human graders can then evaluate one or a few assignments from each cluster and their comments can be diffused by the network to provide specific feedback to a large number of student solutions Both the program tree matching algorithms involved and the evaluation of consistency of transport along different network paths generate interesting research problems Unlike crowd sourced solutions this approach makes more parsimonious use of human resources and may lead to more fair and consistent results Look Who s in the Pool Regulars of the Stanford swimming pool will soon be surprised to discover a new denizen Sinbad an underwater robot in the form of a human diver Unlike conventional underwater vehicles Sinbad has been designed specifically to safely explore fragile coral reef environments Sinbad s compliant lightweight arms agile body stereo vision and tactile fingers will allow the robot to inspect collect samples build structures and perform manipulation tasks under the guidance of a marine biologist The robot effectively extends the human s hands to reach and touch remote fragile environments achieved through an intuitive user interface a fast optical communication link with a bimanual haptic device and an advanced whole body robot controller The haptic device allows the biologist to control the interaction of the robot hands with the marine environment while the complex robot movement coordination is facilitated by the whole body controller so that operators can focus on the actual task they want to perform Directed by Prof Oussama Khatib a team of 19 researchers from Stanford the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology KAUST and MEKA Robotics are busy building the first prototype which will be deployed in the Stanford pool in early 2014 To learn more about Sinbad and the project please visit theRed Sea Robotics Exploratorium project webpage Steering People to Create Vibrant Communities How do we create and maintain vibrant online communities How do we motivate people to actively contribute to the community Prof Jure Leskovec together with his PhD student Ashton Anderson and collaborators from Cornell University has been studying how to steer human behavior in online communities based on badges In communities like Wikipedia Khan Academy Foursquare and Stack Over ow badges are given to users for specific actions or contributions to the community or site Badges serve as a summary of a user s key accomplishments and users tend to put in nontrivial amounts of work to achieve particular badges badges can thus act as powerful incentives Prof Leskovec and his collaborators have been studying how best to use badges to reward users for their achievements and contributions They built a mathematical model that is able to accurately predict how user behavior gets warped in the presence of badges Moreover their methodology can be used to determine optimal incentives to steer user behavior in a desired direction Optimal badging leads both to increased participation and to changes in the type of activities that users pursue Currently Prof Leskovec and his collaborators are deploying their methods at the online educational start up Coursera with the goal of providing a set of incentive mechanisms that will lead to increased student participation in courses and lower drop out rates Faculty and Staff Awards and Honors It s been another banner year for major faculty awards David Dill Elected to American Academy of Arts and Sciences David Dill again Elected to National Academy of Engineering Ed Feigenbaum IEEE Computer Pioneer Award Sachin Katti Sloan Foundation Fellow Nick McKeown ACM SIGCOMM Lifetime Contribution Award Subhasish Mitra IEEE Fellow Eric Roberts Karl V Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award Yoav Shoham ACM Fellow Yoav Shoham again ACM AAAI Allen

category Daphne Koller andAndrew Ng were among Time Magazine s 100 Most Influential People and our beloved long term department manager Peche Turnerreceived the Staff Leadership Award across the entire School of Engineering Finally Mehran Sahami was selected by the Stanford graduating class to be this year s Class Day speaker a campus wide honor never before bestowed upon a CS professor Mehran delivered his Class Day lecture to a packed Maples Pavilion Dissertation Awards Each year ACM honors the best Computer Science dissertations through its Doctoral Dissertation Awards Although Stanford didn t capture the big prize in 2012 one of the two Honorable Mentions goes to a Stanford Ph D and the other to an incoming faculty member Peter Hawkins dissertation Data Representation Synthesis explores the problem of specifying combinations of data structures with complex sharing and results in provably correct code In his work on program synthesis he developed techniques that allow programmers to write their code at a high level aiding verification while still retaining control over low level details that are important for efficiency Peter who now works at Google was a student of Prof Alex Aiken Gregory Valiant s dissertation Algorithmic Approaches to Statistical Questions examines several basic statistical questions from the computational perspective This work at the intersection of algorithms learning information theory and statistics provides insights into several of the challenges encountered in the analysis of today s large datasets Greg was advised by Prof Christos Papadimitriou at UC Berkeley and he spent a year as a post doc at Microsoft Research in New England before joining the Stanford faculty in Autumn 2013 Student News Our students continue

Award for the best MS research report went to Tao Wang for Scene Text Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks His advisors were Profs Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller Teaching Awards The Computer Science Department s Forsythe Teaching Award went to co winners Sebastien Robaszkiewicz and Maria Kazandjieva Sebastien who goes by Robi also won a School of Engineering Centennial TA Award Robi was the teaching assistant for CS147 Introduction to HCI Design With 250 students enrolled CS147 may well have been the largest studio design course taught anywhere Using a flipped classroom format Robi was instrumental in designing in class activities that were engaging and educational across a diverse student population Maria was the teaching assistant for CS144 Introduction to Computer Networking Despite being in the throes of finishing her PhD Maria volunteered to TA CS144 for a third time not to earn funding or to satisfy a requirement but simply due to her love for teaching and helping other students The students and instructors couldn t have been happier to have Maria on the CS144 course staff one last time ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest Stanford once again advanced to the ACM ICPC World Finals held in St Petersburg Russia this summer Our World Finals team comprised of rising seniors Huaiyu Nick Wu Jack Chen and Rohan Puttagunta were invited to the finals after taking first place at the Pacific Northwest Regional Contest Our team once again made Stanford proud at the World Finals as they tied for 14th place with the same ranking as MIT and solving the same number of problems as some of the bronze medalist teams CS lecturer Jerry Cain who has coached the Stanford team since 2003 was honored by ACM ICPC with a Coach Award in recognition of bringing Stanford to seven of the last ten World Finals Computer Forum News It s not only CS majors and enrollments hitting record highs this year The Computer Forum our long standing industrial affiliates program has reached a new record breaking membership of 116 companies Although member benefits include access to both research and recruiting given the hot hiring climate in the valley we find many of our newer members are particularly interested in recruiting This year the Computer Forum helped member companies fill over 300 internship and full time openings and hosted hundreds of events including career fairs information sessions company tours and on campus one one interviews On the research side the Annual Meeting was a big success as always with a theme this year of Big Data In addition to the main meeting workshops were held in the areas of Security Mobile Social Computing and Information Management Between the main meeting and the workshops we had over 300 attendees Many international companies send representatives to the Annual Meeting and workshops each year but for more extended research interactions the Computer Forum offers a year long visiting scholar program This year we had 20 visiting scholars working directly with faculty and graduate students in a variety of CS research groups Now more than ever the Computer Forum is the prime vehicle for companies to recruit students and collaborate in research If your company is interested in either of these interactions or better yet both please consider signing up Until the next newsletter have a

Alumni and Friends This past June I shook hands with nearly 400 graduates as they crossed the stage at Frost Amphitheater to receive their diplomas Commencement is one of the few times I wear heels of any significant height it s an attempt to close the gap slightly between my stature and that of your average graduate so my feet were killing me On top of that my mortarboard slipped a few millimeters back with each handshake But I couldn t have been happier It s the first time we ve held the computer science commencement ceremony in Frost s beautiful and majestic setting Our traditional venue has been the courtyard of the Gates Computer Science building but we ve outgrown that space Over the past five years the number of undergraduate CS majors has almost quadrupled I mentioned in last year s newsletter that CS is the largest major on campus now we re almosttwice the size of the second largest major human biology Later in the newsletter I ll mention some of our secrets to achieving such unprecedented popularity Incidentally those 400 graduates were comprised of roughly 220 BS degrees 150 MS degrees and 30 PhDs Another number that continues to rise to our great delight is the percentage of our undergraduate majors who are women While the national average lingers around 15 we re dramatically higher at 25 and growing We owe a debt of gratitude to some of our upperclass women CS majors who have tirelessly made themselves available to chat with underclass women and to organize events where prospective majors can meet amazing women alums who are making a splash in their jobs and loving it I make a point of checking in with women CS majors about how they re feeling in a traditionally male dominated field More and more often they don t even know why I m asking We re not done yet but that s great progress This past year also saw the approval of a new Joint Major Program in CS with the humanities enabling Stanford s multi faceted students to explore and integrate two very different areas of interest We hired two promising young faculty and one well known senior professor continued to conduct high impact research across the entire field and garnered the usual slew of student faculty and staff awards All of these developments are covered below Finally as an example of our outreach activities I ll describe an inspiring program that brought introductory computer science to low income high school students in Turkey On a personal note after 5 years I m finally stepping down as CS department chair It s been an extraordinary experience to serve the department and to learn more about the School of Engineering and the university I liken our department to a large ship moving through the ocean The role of the department chair is largely to ensure that the ship plows smoothly through the waves and doesn t get blown off course My experience has been that the CS ship is so stable and so strong only a light touch on the helm has been needed and it s been an honor In the remainder of this newsletter please enjoy the many departmental highlights of the 2013 14 academic year New Faculty We re exceedingly pleased to have three new faculty joining the department in the fall of 2014 While on the surface they represent well established subfields of computer science networking artificial intelligence and human computer interaction each of them boasts an unusual portfolio of application areas and technical interests Keep an eye on these guys Stefano Ermon is receiving his Ph D from Cornell University under the supervision of Profs Carla Gomes and Bart Selman Stefano works broadly in the area of Artificial Intelligence with research contributions across probabilistic reasoning machine learning and control theory Stefano has applied many of his results and techniques to a new area known as computational sustainability with breakthroughs ranging from fishery management to optimizing electric car battery use Recognizing his leadership in this emerging field Stefano will also be named a Fellow of Stanford s Woods Institute for the Environment We re very excited about this new connection James Landay comes to us after holding faculty positions at UC Berkeley University of Washington and Cornell NYC Tech We re confident that Stanford will be James final resting place James fills a critical gap in the department s Human Computer Interaction group which had shrunk to just one junior faculty member at the same time the HCI field is burgeoning in popularity With his vast leadership experience a history of building vibrant research groups and attracting top graduate students and a strong interdisciplinary ethic we expect James to be a force in the department while forging bridges with the d school and across the university Keith Winstein is receiving his Ph D from MIT under the supervision of Prof Hari Balaksrishnan Keith works in the area of computer networks and systems He has developed several widely used innovative software systems including the Sprout transport protocol for high throughput in wireless networks the Mosh remote terminal application for mobile clients and Remy a program that uses Bayesian inference to generate congestion control algorithms In his other life Keith spent three years as a reporter for the Wall Street Journal and he s long been involved in issues surrounding copyright law and internet policy Keith will hold a courtesy faculty appointment in Stanford s Law School another connection we re very excited about Tenure and Retirement I m pleased to announce that Prof Gill Bejerano jointly appointed in CS and Developmental Biology has been promoted to Associate Professor with tenure Gill s work at the intersection of two fields combining laboratory benches with serious computation is a wonderful example of the type of interdisciplinary research we expect to become more and more prevalent in the CS department and across the university Meanwhile Prof Marc Levoy has retired his regular faculty position although we look forward to Marc s continued contributions to departmental teaching and student advising Marc created many exciting and highly visible research projects during his time at Stanford His work on 3D laser scanning in the 1990s culminated in the Digital Michelangelo Project in which he and his students spent a year in Italy digitizing statues His 3D scanning techniques are now widely used to make special effects for movies Marc is also well known for his work on computational photography a now ubiquitous term he first coined in 2004 for a Stanford course In 1996 together with Prof Pat Hanrahan Marc invented light field imaging which allows the capture of real world objects in a way that provides the ability to change focus and perspective after the imagery is captured This technology is now known to consumers through the Lytro light field camera Post retirement Marc is working at Google where he has been involved in many projects including the Google book scanner Street View and cameras for Google Glass and Android devices Popularity of the CS Major Our Secret Sauce As department chair these days I m frequently what our trick is how we ve attracted so many students to major in computer science I ve been assured it s not that the admissions office has decided to favor techies In fact a large fraction of our majors had no intention of pursuing computer science or any other form of engineering for that matter when they arrived at Stanford So what happened Soon enough every freshman hears about a legendary class CS106A Perhaps peer pressure is a contributor but one way or another a huge fraction of Stanford students are now braving the CS106A waters some with considerable initial trepidation We have truly outstanding instructors in the CS106 courses who quickly and ably convey to a wide variety of students the challenges and joy of creating computer programs and of computer science as a field of study The students soon realize that it can be a lot more fun to learn a subject where everyone finds his or her own unique solution to each problem rather than being in a class where getting a different answer from one s classmates means getting it wrong As students move on to subsequent CS courses they learn that computer science is a unique combination of engineering design intuition logic creativity and perseverance and they re hooked New CS X Joint Major Program Many Stanford students have strong interests in fields in addition to computer science yet they choose computer science as their sole major because double majoring is notoriously difficult necessitating all requirements of two majors with no double counting of classes and a double major provides neither time nor a structured opportunity for integrating the two fields Students who are interested in both a humanities field say and CS are more likely to choose CS as their major for purely practical reasons What a shame that these students aren t able to pursue both of their passions Enter the new Joint Major Program dubbed CS X Starting next year the university has approved CS X programs for ten majors across seven partner humanities departments The intention is to eventually include partners in the social sciences natural sciences and other parts of the university but the pilot is of limited scope to get things started and see how they go While music and linguistics are obvious partners we re also excited about the prospect of joint majors in English philosophy and Slavic languages among others On the computer science side students undertaking the Joint Major may drop two electives from the CS major requirements and their senior project is required to be a capstone that integrates CS and the partner major Computation and data are rapidly becoming integral to a wide variety of other fields so students and their advisors should have little difficulty coming up with interesting projects We have a long tradition of CS department research collaborations outside of the department We re very excited to now offer interdisciplinary opportunities to eager undergraduates Introductory Computer Science for Turkish High Schoolers K 12 education in Turkey has a strong tradition in math and science but the country has a relatively small presence in software In June 2014 a team from the CS department taught a two week intensive class in Java programming to high school students at Darussafaka boarding school in Istanbul The students at Darussafaka are from low income families across Turkey and all of them have lost one or both parents In just two weeks 25 eager 10th and 11th graders covered the entire CS106A curriculum from Karel to Breakout and beyond The class was organized by Prof Nick McKeown and his Turkish wife Asena the teaching team included some of our very talented TAs and section leaders Chris Piech Bryce Cronkite Ratcliff Julia Lee Nick Troccoli and TY Huang Research Activities As always a tremendous amount of exciting research is going on in the department Please enjoy these three samples and visit the CS Department website to learn about our ongoing research across the entire field OpenRadio We frequently complain of poor mobile wireless connectivity Yet paradoxically we are awash with connectivity options Walking around a city we see tens of WiFi access points and several cellular options but our devices cannot access the available capacity The OpenRadio project led byProf Sachin Katti virtualizes wireless networks enabling users to stitch together the connectivity they need from the networks around them Instead of a fixed bill every month to access a single network users pick and choose the best options at any point depending on their needs availability and cost In the long term OpenRadio decouples wireless network service from the infrastructure and enables the definition of wireless radio networks in software from the lowest radio level to higher layer network services Software definition enables more flexible networks efficient use of scarce spectrum and in the long run turns wireless physical infrastructure such as cell towers into a shared utility on top of which different service provides can define their network service in software Then networks will compete on the quality richness and flexibility of their services and not on who owns more cell towers as is the case today Crowdsourcing a Web Site in One Day What could you accomplish if you could summon together software developers designers and user researchers all on demand and within minutes Could you transform a napkin sketch of a design idea into a working user tested mobile application in 24 hours Prof Michael Bernsteinhas been working with a group of students to create computationally managed flash teams of crowdsourced experts Their platform has managed flash teams from online labor markets e g oDesk to create web applications short animations from scratch and an online class platform complete with content Experiments suggest the flash teams are twice as efficient as self managed teams Underlying flash tasks is an online system for authoring teams and managing them at runtime through structured handoffs This system can grow and shrink teams on demand pipeline output and combine modular team elements to create entire small organizations Carbon Nanotube Computer Further miniaturization of computing systems in silicon is limited fundamentally by physics Representing a radical departure from traditional silicon transistors with semiconducting channels made of carbon nanotubes offer a significant opportunity to solve this outstanding challenge After the first demonstration of carbon nanotube transistors in 1998 there was great excitement about a new age of energy efficient computing systems However challenging material imperfections inherent to carbon nanotubes stalled progress Recently Prof Subhasish Mitra joint with EE together with his EE colleague Prof Philip Wong and their students made a major breakthrough making it possible to build robust computing systems that perform correctly despite substantial carbon nanotube imperfections Their paper describing the first carbon nanotube based microprocessor was featured on the cover of Nature Prof Mitra and Wong s widely publicized milestone promises to transform the landscape of exploratory nanotechnologies from stand alone transistor demonstrations to actual nanosystems Faculty and Staff Awards and Honors It s been another banner year for major faculty

extends HLSL with new capabilities for building modular extensible and high performance real time shading systems Slang is now the shading language for NVIDIA s Falcor research rendering system See the Slang website or the SIGGRAPH 2018 paper for more Self Refining Interactive Games graphics with 100 s of machines and a lot of latency How do we build platforms that take graphics applications from one user on a single GPU to 10 000 machines and one million users in the cloud Even though computer graphics has always been at the vanguard of parallel computing there has been little success using modern cloud based computing resources to improve interactive experiences In this project we asked the question how could we leverage the massive storage and batch processing capabilities of the cloud to generate new forms of interactive worlds and we took a precompute everything approach to doing so Since one cannot precompute everything about an complex interactive world the challenge is to determine what is most important to precompute so these parts can be presented to the user with the highest quality graphics We find that by recording statistics of users playing a game we can build a model of user behavior and then concentrate large scale cloud based precomputation of graphics and physics around the states that users are most likely to encounter The result is a self refining game whose dynamics improve with play ultimately providing realistically rendered rich fluid dynamics in real time on a mobile device For more detail see our work applied these ideas to cloth simulation and fluid simulation A Real Time Micropolygon Rendering Pipeline evolving the GPU pipeline for tiny triangles GPUs will soon have the compute horsepower to render scenes containing cinematic quality surfaces in real time Unfortunately if they render these subpixel polygons micropolygons using the same techniques as they do for large triangles today GPUs will perform extremely inefficiently Instead of trying to parallelize Pixar s Reyes micropolygon rendering system we re taking a hard look at how the existing Direct3D 11 rendering pipeline and GPU hardware implementations must evolve to render micropolygon workloads efficiently in a high throughput system Changes to software interfaces algorithms and HW design are fair game Slides describing what we ve learned can be found in this SIGGRAPH course talk or in my dissertation Evolving the Real Time Graphics Pipeline for Micropolygon Rendering GRAMPS a framework for heterogeneous parallel programming There are two ways to think about GRAMPS Graphics folks should think of GRAMPS as a system for building custom graphics pipelines We simply gave up on adding more and more configurable knobs to existing pipelines like OpenGL Direct3D and instead allow the programmer to programmatically define a custom pipeline with an arbitrary number of stages connected by queues To non graphics folks GRAMPS is a stream programming system that embraces heterogeneity in underlying architecture and anticipates streaming workloads that exhibit both regular and irregular dynamic behavior The GRAMPS runtime dynamically schedules GRAMPS programs onto architectures containing a mixture of compute optimized cores generic CPU cores and fixed function processing units The Sequoia Programming Language Programming the Memory Hierarchy Sequoia is a hierarchical stream programming language that arose from the observation that expressing locality not parallelism is the most important responsibility of parallel application programmers in scientific numerical domains Sequoia presents a parallel machine as an abstract hierarchy of memories and gives the programmer explicit control over data locality and communication through this hierarchy using first class language constructs basically Sequoia supports nested kernels and streams of streams Sequoia programs have run on a variety of exposed communication architectures such as clusters the CELL processor GPUs and even supercomputing clusters at Los Alamos The best way to learn about Sequoia is to read our SC06 paper Brook Merrimac stream processing for scientific computing I helped out with the BrookGPU abstracting the GPU as a stream processor for numerical computing and Merrimac Streaming Supercomputer projects Brook was the academic precursor to

DeepDive is a new type of system to extract value from dark data Like dark matter dark data is the great mass of data buried in text tables figures and images which lacks structure and so is essentially unprocessable by existing data systems DeepDive s most popular use case is to transform the dark data of web pages pdfs and other databases into rich SQL style databases In turn these databases can be used to support both SQL style and predictive analytics Recently some DeepDive based applications have exceeded the quality of human volunteer annotators in both precision and recall for complex scientific articles Data produced by DeepDive is used by several law enforcement agencies and NGOs to fight human trafficking The technical core of DeepDive is an engine that combines extraction integration and prediction into a single engine with probabilistic inference as its core operation A one pager with key design highlights is here PaleoDeepDive is featured in the July 2015 issue of Nature DeepDive is our attempt to understand a new type of database system Our new approach can be summarized as follows the data the output of various tools the input from users including the program the developer writes are observations from which the system statistically infers the answer This view is a radical departure from traditional data processing systems which assume that the data is one hundred percent correct A key problem in DeepDive is that the system needs to consider many possible interpretations for each data item In turn we need to explore a huge number of combinations during probabilistic inference which is one of the core technical challenges Our goal is to acquire more sources of data for DeepDive to understand more deeply to change the way that science and industry operate 2 Fundamentals of Data Processing Almost all data processing systems have their intellectual roots in first order logic The most computationally expensive and most interesting operation in such systems is the relational join Recently I helped discover the first join algorithm with optimal worst case running time This result uses a novel connection between logic combinatorics and geometry We are using this connection to develop new attacks on classical problems in listing patterns in graphs and in statistical inference Two threads have emerged The first theme is that these new worst case optimal algorithms are fundamentally different from the algorithms used in most of today s data processing systems Although our algorithm is optimal in the worst case commercial relational database engines have been tuned to work well on real data sets by smart people for about four decades And so a difficult question is how does one translate these insights into real data processing systems The second theme is that we may need new techniques to get theoretical results strong enough to guide practice As a result I ve started thinking about beyond worst case analysis and things like conditioning for combinatorial problems to hopefully build theory that can inform practice to a greater extent The first papers have just been posted Demos Examples and Papers Worst case Optimal Joins We have posted a survey for SIGMOD record about recent advances in join algorithms Our goal is to give a high level view of the results for practitioners and applied researchers We also managed to simplify the arguments A full version of our join algorithm with worst case optimal running time is here The LogicBlox guys have their own commercial worst case optimal algorithm Our new system EmptyHeaded is based on this theory Beyond Worst case Joins This work is our attempt to go beyond worst case analysis for join algorithms We with Dung Nguyen develop a new algorithm that we call Minesweeper based on these ideas The main theoretical idea is to formalize the amount of work any algorithm spends certifying using a set of propositional statements that the output set is complete and not say a proper subset We call this set of propositions the certificate We manage to establish a dichotomy theorem for this stronger notion of complexity if a query is what Ron Fagin calls beta acyclic then Minesweeper runs in time linear in the certificate if a query is beta cyclic than on some instance any algorithm takes time that is super linear in the certificate The results get sharper and more fun Almost to one algorithm to rule them all We have a much better description of beyond worst case optimality with a resolution framework and a host of new results for different indexing strategies This paper supercedes many of the results in Minesweeper and in a much nicer way We also hope to connect more of geometry and resolution but we ll see A first part of our attack on conditioning for combinatorial problems is in NIPS and on Arxiv It is not difficult to get me interested in a theory problem Ask around the Infolab if you don t believe me Our goal is to understand the fundamentals of data processing systems CS229 Machine Learning Spring 19 Fall 19 Spring 20 Fall 20 CS145 Introduction to Databases Fall 14 Fall 15 Fall 16 CS346 Database System

Databricks a data and AI platform startup Before joining Stanford I was an assistant professor at MIT Interests I m interested in computer systems for emerging large scale workloads such as machine learning big data analytics and cloud computing In DAWN we re working on infrastructure for usable machine learning to make it dramatically easier to bring ML applications to production these issues are often much larger obstacles than ML algorithms in practice My work includes software runtimes quality assurance tools and systems optimizations for ML Beyond usability I am intersted in data privacy as the flipside to big data and have worked on systems that can provide scalable privacy for communication Internet queries and SaaS applications Impact Our group works closely with the open source community to test and publish our ideas During my PhD I started the Apache Spark project which is now one of the most widely used frameworks for distributed data processing and co started other widely used datacenter software such as Apache Mesos Alluxio and Spark Streaming At Stanford we developed DAWNBench a machine learning performance competition that drew submissions from the top industry groups and influenced the industry standard MLPerf and we are continuing to develop open source software such as Weld Sparser NoScope and MacroBase DIFF Some of our work has been featured in

time at Google and finding people there who wanted to know more about photography I decided to teach a revised but nearly full version of my Stanford course CS 178 Digital Photography at Google These lectures were recorded and edited to remove proprietary material at which point Google permitted me to make them public Here is a link to this course which I called Lectures on Digital Photography I also uploaded the lecture videos as a YouTube playlist where to my surprise they went viral in September 2016 A Googler made a word cloud at left algorithmically from the comments on those videos and sent it to me as a gift In a word cloud the size of each word is proportional to the number of times it appears in the text being processed by the algorithm It s one of the nicest gifts I have ever received For several years my research focused on making cameras programmable One concrete outcome of this project was our Frankencamera architecture published in this SIGGRAPH 2010 paper and commercialized in Android s Camera2 HAL3 APIs To help me understand the challenges of building photographic applications for a mobile platform I tried writing an iPhone app myself The result was SynthCam By capturing tracking aligning and blending a sequence of video frames the app made the near pinhole aperture on an iPhone camera act like the large aperture of a single lens reflex SLR camera This includes the SLR s shallow depth of field and resistance to noise in low light The app launched in January 2011 and seeing it appear in the App Store was a thrill I originally charged 0 99 but eventually made it free Here are a few of my favorite reviews of the app MIT Technology Review WiReD The Economist Unfortunately with my growing involvement at Google I stopped maintaining the app and it stopped working with iOS 11 In 1999 the National Academies published Funding a Revolution Government Support for Computing Research This landmark study sometimes called the Brooks Sutherland report argued that research in computer science often takes 15 years to pay off The iconic illustration from that report is reproduced at right In 1996 Pat Hanrahan and I begin working on light fields and synthetic focusing supported by the National Science Foundation In 2005 Ren Ng a PhD student in our lab worked out an optical design that allowed dense light fields to be captured using a handheld camera This design enabled everyday photographs to be refocused after they are captured I worked on this technology alongside Ren in the Stanford Graphics Laboratory and later applied it to microscopy but the key ideas behind the light field camera were his Ren s doctoral dissertation titled Digital Light Field Photography received the 2006 ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award In the same year Ren started a company called Refocus Imaging to commercialize this technology In 2011 that company renamed Lytro announced its first camera So 15 years from initial idea to first product An exciting ride but a long wait At left is the Lytro 1 camera and below it the first picture I took using the camera refocused after capture at a near distance then a far distance Unfortunately aside from being refocusable Lytro cameras didn t take great pictures and refocusability wasn t a strong enough differenting feature to drive consumer demand so the product and the follow on Lytro Illum camera weren t successful My Google career Selected highlights Gaurav Garg taking video for CityBlock later productized as Google StreetView Figure 1 from US patent 7 586 655 on the design of a book scanner Wearing

2019 My portion of the Keynote address at the launch of Pixel 4 2019 Chronology In 1993 while as Assistant Professor at Stanford I lent a few disk drives to PhD students David Filo and Jerry Yang so they could build a table of contents of the internet This later became Yahoo In 1996 Larry Page and Sergey Brin also PhD students at Stanford began assembling a pile of disk drives two doors down from my office to build an index of the internet This later became Google Hmmm table of contents versus index At the time both ideas made some sense but history shows which approach scaled better as the internet grew While Larry shared an office with my grad students I also got to know Sergey well as a student in one of my computer graphics courses In 2002 I launched a Google funded Stanford research project called CityBlock which Google later commercialized as StreetView For an overview of the Stanford project see this talk I gave at the 2004 Stanford Computer Science Department retreat This article in TechCrunch outlines the project s later history at Google except that the video Larry Page and Marissa Meyer captured while driving around San Francisco predated my project at Stanford not the other way around as the article says I still have his video in my attic In 2003 working as a consultant for Google I co designed the book scanner for Google s Project Ocean whose goal was to non destructively digitize millions of books from six of the world s largest libraries the University of Michigan Harvard Harvard University Library Stanford Green Library Oxford Bodleian Library and the New York Public Library While the scanner design actually used in the project is a Google trade secret the patent linked above is representative of the technologies we were exploring See also this CNET article or this coverage from National Public Radio Francois Marie Lefevere the co inventor on this second patent was formerly one of my students From 2011 through 2020 I built and led a team at Google that worked broadly on cameras and photography serving first as visiting faculty in GoogleX and later as a full time Principal Engineer and Distinguished Engineer in Google Research The internal team name was Gcam which became public when this GoogleX blog article appeared Our first project was burst mode photography for high dynamic range HDR imaging which we launched in the Explorer edition of Google Glass See also this public talk This work was later extended and applied to mobile photography launching as HDR mode in the Google Camera app on multiple generations of Nexus and Pixel smartphones The French agency DxO gave the 2016 Pixel the highest rating ever given to a smartphone camera and an even higher rating to the Pixel 2 in 2017 Here are some albums of photos I shot with the Pixel XL Desolation Wilderness Cologne and Paris New York City Fort Ross and Sonoma County Press i Info for per picture captions In 2017 we branched out from HDR imaging to synthetic shallow depth of field based loosely on my 2011 SynthCam app for iPhones The first version of this technology launched as Portrait Mode on Pixel 2 see example above Here is an album of portrait mode shots of people and another of small objects like flowers See also this interview in The Verge this cute explanatory video about the Pixel 2 s camera and these papers in SIGGRAPH Asia 2016 on HDR and SIGGRAPH 2018 on portrait mode We later extended portrait mode to use machine learning to estimate depth published in ICCV 2019 and on Pixel 4 to use both dual pixels and dual cameras In 2018 my team developed or collaborated with other teams on several additional technologies Super Res Zoom paper in SIGGRAPH 2019 synthetic fill flash learning based white balancing papers in CVPR 2015 and CVPR 2017 and Night Sight paper in SIGGRAPH 2019 These technologies launched on Pixel 3 Night Sight was inspired by my prototype SeeInTheDark app which is described in this public talk but was never released as a standalone app Night Sight has won numerous awards including DP Review s 2018 Innovation of the Year and the Disruptive Device Innovation Award at Mobile World Congress 2019 See also these inteviews by DP Review and CNET In 2019 we launched a real time version of HDR called Live HDR which made Pixel 4 s viewfinder WYSIWYG What You See Is What You Get and Dual Exposure Controls which allowed separate control over image brightness and tone mapping interactively at time of capture a first for any camera In Pixel 4 we also extended Night Sight to astrophotography My team had been exploring this problem for a while see this 2017 article by Google team member Florian Kainz However Florian s experiments required a custom written camera app and manual post processing On Pixel 4 consumers could capture similar pictures with a single button press either handheld or stabilized such as Florian s stunning tripod photograph see above of the Milky Way over Haleakala in Hawaii Note that pictures like this still require aligning and merging a burst of frames because over a 4 minute capture the stars do move Is there art as well as science in our work on Pixel phones Lots of it check out this short video by Google on how Italian art influenced the look of Pixel s photography Finally my team also worked on underlying technologies for Project Jump a light field camera that captures stereo panoramic videos for VR headsets such as Google Cardboard See also this May 2015 presentation at Google I O A side project I did at Google in 2016 was to record a modified version of my quarter long Stanford course CS 178 Digital Photography in front of a live audience of Googlers The videos and PDFs of these lectures are available to the public for free here See also this YouTube playlist Oh yes and then there is the story about how Google got its name due to a spelling mistake made by one of my Stanford graduate students To hear the full story you ll have to treat me to a glass of wine Will cell phones replace SLRs Although I ve largely moved from SLRs to mirrorless cameras for my big camera needs I m frankly using big cameras less and less because they have poor dynamic range unless I use bracketing and post processing and they take poor pictures at night unless I use a tripod Both of these use cases have become easy and reliable on cell phones due mainly to computational photography HDR mode on Nexus and Pixel smartphones is one example These pictures were taken with the 2015 era Nexus 6P the left image with HDR mode off and the right image with HDR mode on Click on the thumbnails to see them at full resolution Look how much cleaner brighter and sharper the HDR image is Also the stained glass window at the end of the nave is not over exposed and there is more detail in the side arches Taking a step back the tech press is fond of saying that computational photography on cell phones is making big cameras obsolete Let s think this through It is true that sales of interchangeable lens cameras ILCs which include SLRs and mirrorless cameras have dropped by half since 2013 and point and shoot cameras have largely disappeared in lockstep with the growth of mobile phones Similarly Photokina the world s largest photography trade show has shrunk by half in the last 5 years There are confounding factors at play here including the decimation of professional photography niches like photojournalism due to shifts in how news is gathered and disseminated But improvements in the quality of mobile photography over the last decade is certainly a contributor to these changes Rishi Sanyal Science Editor for DP Review who has written extensively about Pixel 3 and Pixel 4 once estimated that the signal to noise ratio SNR of merged RAW files from Pixel 4 matches that of RAW files from a micro four thirds camera I think Pixel s dynamic range is actually better roughly matching that of a full frame camera due to low read noise on Sony s recent mobile sensors but in either case the trend is clear I also note that as we move from SLRs to mirrorless cameras hence from optical to electronic viewfinders the dynamic range of the viewfinder becomes more important In this respect the Pixel 4 with its Live HDR firmly beats the electronic viewfinders on big mirrorless cameras The SNR of cell phone viewfinders still lags but I expect this to become better in the future When Pixel 2 won DP Review s Innovation of the Year in 2017 comments in the user forums were running 60 40 in favor of This isn t real photography By the time Pixel 3 won the same award again in 2018 user forum comments were running 80 20 in favor of Why aren t the SLR makers doing this Actually a few mirrorless cameras do offer single shutter press burst capture and automatic merging of frames But as of 2020 these modes produce only JPEGs not merged RAW files and their merging algorithms use only global homographies not robust tile by tile alignment As a result they work poorly when the camera is handheld or there is motion in the scene It s hard to resist concluding that this is a classic case of disruptive technology as described by Clayton Christensen in The Innovator s Dilemma Cell phones entered at the bottom of the market so traditional camera makers didn t see them as a threat to their business Slowly but inexorably mobile photography improved due to better sensors and optics and to algorithmic innovations by Google and its competitors Computational photography played a role and so did machine learning So also did Google s culture of publication which allowed other companies to become fast followers By the time traditional camera companies realized that their market was in danger it was too late Even now in 2020 they seem slow to respond I analyzed their slowness in this 2010 article the same year we published our Frankencamera architecture commercialized by Google in its Camera2 HAL3 API Little has changed since then except that cell phones have become more capable Full disclosure one factor I missed in my 2010 article was that while large cameras have powerful special purpose image processing engines they have relatively weak programmable processors At the same time they have more pixels to process than cell phones because their sensors are larger These two factors made innovation difficult In the end it s hard to avoid thinking it s Game Over for ILCs except in niches like sports and wildlife photography where big glass is mandated by the laws of physics Even Annie Leibovitz thinks this For the rest of us it s not only that the best camera is the one that s with you it may also be true that the camera that s with you meaning your cell phone is your best camera My Adobe

in 1989 After the ceremony a number of people asked for the text of my address Here it is retrospectively titled Where do disruptive ideas come from Or here is UNC s version with more photos like the one at left And here is the video Portrait photographer Louis Fabian Bachrach took some nice photographs here and here of me in 1997 for the Computer Museum in Boston now closed I do occasionally wear something besides blue dress shirts Here are shots with other shirts from August 2001 and July 2003 Yes that s a Death Ride T shirt in the last shot I also rode in 2005 and yes I finished all 5 passes 15 000 feet of climbing That s why I m smiling in the official ride photograph shown at left taken at the top of Carson Pass after 12 hours of cycling During a 1998 99 sabbatical in Italy my students and I digitized 10 of Michelangelo s statues in Florence We called this the Digital Michelangelo Project Here are some photographic essays about personal aspects of the sabbatical In particular I spent the year learning to carve in marble At left is my first piece a mortar with decorated supports Here are some sculptures by my mother who unlike me had real talent The Digital Michelangelo Project was not my first foray into measuring and rendering 3D objects Here are some drawings I made in college for the Historic American Buildings Survey In this project the measuring was done by hand using rulers architect s combs and similar devices I still like finding and measuring old objects especially if it involves getting dirty This photographic essay describes a week I spent on an archaeological dig in the Roman Forum The image at left taken during the dig graces the front cover of The Bluffer s Guide to Archaeology My favorite radio interview by Noah Adams of National Public

story and pictures and here for a direct link to the audio as an mp3 file Finally here s a text only interview at SIGGRAPH 2003 by Wendy Ju with reminiscences of my early mentors in computer graphics Speaking of computer graphics I m fond of the front cover of the Siggraph 2001 proceedings The image is from a paper in the proceedings on subsurface scattering co authored with Henrik Wann Jensen Steve Marschner and Pat Hanrahan And check out this milk This paper won a Technical Academy Award in 2004 Subsurface scattering is now ubiquitous in CG intensive movies However not everything went smoothly at Siggraph 2001 A more strenuous than expected after Siggraph hike inspired Pat Hanrahan s and my students to create this humorous movie poster Click here for the innocent version of this story And here for the real story Genealogy A lot of my early Stanford research related to volume data The cause may be genetic My mother s cousin David Chesler is credited with the first demonstration of filtered backprojection the dominant method used in computed tomography CT and positron emission tomography PET for combining multiple projections to yield 3D medical data Here is a description of his contributions My father s genes also seem to be guiding my research tastes Optics has been in my family for four generations My father Barton Monroe Levoy and my grandfather Monroe Benjamin Levoy were opticians and sellers of eyeglasses through their company Tura At left is an early brochure Going back further my great grandfather Benjamin Monroe Levoy sold eyeglasses cameras microscopes and other optical instruments in New York City a century ago Here is a piece of stationery from his store He later moved to 42nd street as evidenced by the address on the case of these
