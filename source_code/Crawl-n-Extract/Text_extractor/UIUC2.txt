North America to receive a 2020 Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship Yu is designing high performance hardware systems that defend against microarchitectural side and covert channel attacks like Spectre and Meltdown which involve a fundamental security vulnerability affecting most microprocessors where a malicious program can exploit speculative execution and caching to gain access to data that was previously considered secure Yu s approach is unique in the computer architecture community Rather than design point defenses to specific side or covert channels like cache he developed a holistic solution that blocks data leakage through every hardware structure His solution drew the interest of Intel which hired him in the summer of 2019 as a research intern Working with Intel s Security and Privacy Research Group Yu modeled various side channel mitigations on the company s CPU simulator He is also developing a hardware framework that targets side channel attacks based on speculative execution He presented this work at the 2019 ACM IEEE International Symposium on Microarchitecture where he received a best paper award A member of assistant professor Christopher Fletcher s research

Computer Science Visionary Scholarship Donors HomeNews CS ILLINOIS students win highly competitive industry PhD fellowships 2 9 2017 1 10 36 PM Laura Schmitt Two CS doctoral students recently received prestigious industry PhD Fellowships that recognize and support innovative research Sangeetha Abdu Jyothi was one of 13 students worldwide who earned a 2017 Facebook Fellowship and Silu Huang was one of 10 students who earned a 2017 Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship A member of CS Associate Professor Brighten Godfrey s group Jyothi is part of a research team that is designing a nearly speed of light Internet Service Provider ISP Current ISP networks use buried fiber optic cables to move data and run much slower than the speed of light in air Sangeetha Abdu JyothiAccording to Jyothi the latency or delay is about 3 4 times higher in conventional fiber optic networks than the speed of light latency because of physical limitations of fiber and geographical constraints of laying the fiber along the shortest routes To address this Godfrey s team is building a network or ISP primarily based on line of sight wireless links meaning they ll combine the speed of microwave connections like those used to connect the stock exchanges with the information carrying capacity of fiber This will significantly improve performance of Internet applications As a 2017 Facebook Fellow Jyothi will receive funding for conference travel and a 37 000 annual stipend for the next two years Facebook will also pay her Illinois tuition and fees during that time The fellowship is a huge boost for my project said Jyothi I m grateful to my advisor Brighten Godfrey too because he has provided such great support for my work A third year PhD student Huang is working with CS Assistant Professor Aditya Parameswaran s group on the DataHub project which is like a GitHub for structured data DataHub will enable data scientists to better collaborate and analyze their shared data DataHub is increasingly necessary as data scientists create hundreds or even thousands of versions of the same data set while performing their analyses Typically a data scientist will copy an original data set make changes or correct errors and then place the new versions on the same shared file system which results in massive redundancy and makes it difficult to share the newly constructed data sets To fulfill the DataHub vision Huang has been studying how to adapt a traditional database for versioning Specifically she is developing data models and a partitioning algorithm to efficiently and effectively bolt on versioning for relational database Known as OrpheusDB the hosted platform incorporates the strengths of a traditional database consistency and querying with standard SQL commands with new attributes like multi version control and compact storage solutions In the summer of 2015 Huang worked at Microsoft Research on approximate query processing which is a problem that arises when trying to extract aggregate information over massive data like sales revenue of individual products from a big database She helped develop sampling and indexing techniques that enabled database users to quickly get a reliable answer to their query with guaranteed error bound According to Huang Microsoft is using this approximate query processing method internally Silu Huang As a Microsoft Research PhD Fellow Huang will receive funding for conference travel and a 28 000 annual stipend for the next two years Microsoft will also pay her Illinois tuition and fees during that time This fellowship means a lot to me because industry finds my work quite useful said Huang who expressed appreciation to her U of I advisor Aditya Parameswaran CS Professor Saurabh Sinha and Microsoft advisor Bolin Ding PhD 12 This gives me motivation to continue my work and allows me to be more focused on the DataHub project Huang is the second CS student to receive this fellowship in the last 10 years Chi Wang PhD 14 a former member of Professor Jiawei Han s group was a 2011 Microsoft Research Fellow Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Instagram Contact Us Thomas M Siebel Center for Computer

HomeNews Noghabi wins Microsoft grant for underrepresented students 7 13 2017 4 18 57 PM David Mercer CS ILLINOIS A CS ILLINOIS doctoral student has won one of the first grants from a new Microsoft Research program aimed at supporting underrepresented groups in computing Shadi Noghabi is one of the 12 winners chosen from among 200 applicants at U S and Canadian universities for the new Microsoft Research Dissertation Grant program She will receive 20 000 to work on her thesis topic Building Large scale Production Systems for Latency sensitive Applications CS Ph D student Shadi NoghabiShe says the project is an outgrowth of her research and internships at LinkedIn and Microsoft Research and she believes it could have real world applications for both the average person using social media and more critical consumer products When you re uploading a photo to your album on Facebook if it takes 10 minutes for you to do that it s just frustrating for the user and you start losing your users Noghabi said Or let s say you have a self driving car if the latency is too much the car might not be safe Noghabi says most of her work has been linked to large scale production systems with in some cases hundreds of millions of users She has contributed to Ambry the geo distributed media store used by LinkedIn to store many of its media projects and to Apache Samza an open source stream processing engine used by LinkedIn Uber and others Her work one of Noghabi s professors says helps set her apart She has collaborated closely with teams building production systems in industry not just research systems but by building real systems that cater to real users said Indranil Gupta an associate professor of Computer Science As part of the grant Noghabi will attend a two day mentoring workshop this fall at the Microsoft Research Redmond Lab where she will meet established researchers hear from the company s senior leaders about Microsoft s scientific work and present a talk on her dissertation research Noghabi is also one of Roy Campbell s students Campbell who is the Sohaib and Sara Abbasi Professor in Computer Science said she will benefit from spending time at the lab She is a leader and independent self starter and this opportunity will allow her to meet new colleagues and to develop her own research skills he said Noghabi says her love of computing began early at age 4 on a PC that belonged to her father I kind of broke it she said laughing They had to throw it away She believes the Microsoft grant will help her follow the path she set out on with that broken PC toward a leadership role in her profession I can move toward becoming a more influential person and also inspire other women to chase their dream she said Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Instagram

HomeNews CRA Awards Recognize Four Illinois CS Undergrads For Research 1 10 2019 11 40 15 AM Two Illinois Computer Science students were finalists for the Computing Research Association s 2019 Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award and two more earned honorable mentions one of the department s best ever performances in the competition Illinois CS students Jonah Casebeer and Ben Zhou were finalists while Harshay Shah and Edward Huang were recognized with honorable mentions from the CRA the association announced in late December The Undergraduate Researcher Award program recognizes undergraduate students in North American colleges and universities who show outstanding research potential in an area of computing research A committee of researchers from eight universities selected four winners and four runners up as well as the finalists and honorable mentions All four Illinois CS entrants were honored the strongest performance by the department since 2015 when Urvashi Khandelwal was among the winners In addition Assistant Professor Edgar Solomonik BS CS 10 was a finalist in 2010 More about this year s Illinois CS undergraduates recognized by the CRA Associate Professor Paris Smaragdis who nominated Jonah Casebeer said the student has worked on a series of challenging research projects in the year plus they have worked together some involving problems that stump even very strong graduate students Jonah Casebeer Smaragdis cited one problem in particular an audio classification system in which he wanted Casebeer to replace standard front end processing with a neural net Two weeks later he comes with a working implementation within a couple of months he had almost matched the state of the art results Smaragdis wrote in his letter nominating Casebeer Mind you that state of the art came from groups with multiple researchers working on this for years in fact many such groups had systems that performed worse than what Jonah did Casebeer who plans to graduate in 2019 has five published peer reviewed papers and more in the works Professor Dan Roth said Ben Zhou was a rarity when he joined Roth s Cognitive Computation Group a sophomore Ben Zhou I would rarely take such a young student to my group Roth wrote in his nomination letter for Zhou But I view Ben as a PhD student already and so do my other students He is considered the authority in my group on a number of important topics such as context sensitive word embeddings Elmo embeddings dataless classification and relation extraction Roth who is now the Eduardo D Glandt Distinguished Professor at the University of Pennsylvania but remains an adjunct professor at Illinois CS praised Zhou in particular for his work on a paper for the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing Roth suggested Zhou work on incidental supervision training machine learning tasks with minimal indirect and weak supervision signals To do so Zhou studied it in the context of recognizing fine semantic types of entities and concepts that problem of identifying through context the semantic types an entity can take that the University of Illinois for example is in coarse type an organization and in fine type an educational institution and that Illinois can be a river in one context and a tennis team in another Ben s work is the first work on semantic typing that has the flexibility to transfer across text genres and domains and to generalize to new type taxonomies Roth wrote It requires no annotated data and can flexibly identify newly defined types Zhou plans to graduate in 2019 and has authored several other papers too Associate Professor Hari Sundaram began working with Harshay Shah in 2016 and said two questions drove the research that Sundaram cited in nominating Shah Why do social networks possess the structure that we observe How do individuals with limited information help create them Harshay Shah We know that people tend to make friends with those who are popular but also to those who are like themselves We know of mechanisms that explain each of these two phenomena separately but not jointly Sundaram said Prior scholarship tends to ignore that fact that individuals have limited information when making these decisions A decision making framework by individuals acting with limited information that accounts for both phenomena simultaneously would connect the macroscopic properties that we observe in real world networks with local decisions by individuals Harshay proposed an Attributed Random Walk ARW model Sundaram said and was able to explain macroscopic network structure while accounting for multiple sociological phenomena Harshay has been instrumental to the development ARW Sundaram wrote We ve started to make extensions to the model and Harshay is now mentoring an undergrad to work alongside him In summary Harshay has all the makings of a star graduate student Harshay plans to graduate in 2019 Edward Huang was nominated by Nigel Bosch a postdoctoral researcher at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications for his work on two projects Edward Huang The first examined students improvement in an online STEM class focused on how much students from underrepresented groups improved over the course of the class Huang impressed with both his programming ability as he dealt with data that originated in a learning management system from the early 1990s and in his careful treatment of the data according to Bosch The second project was also focused on online classes trying to automatically detect metacognitive language in text then measure the amount of such language phrases such as I think the answer is or I am actually not really sure that exists and the degree of confidence these phrases reflect Eddie s method breaks down each piece of text into parts of phrases and filters them based on individual components of metacognitive phrases that he identified such as the negations and adjectives found in these phrases Bosch wrote in nominating Huang Without Eddie s work examining the metacognitive language underrepresented students utilize would still be nothing more than an idea Huang plans to graduate in 2019 Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Instagram Contact Us Thomas M Siebel Center for Computer Science 201 North Goodwin Avenue MC 258 Urbana IL 61801

student Edgar Solomonik has been named a Finalist for the prestigious Computing Research Association CRA Outstanding Undergraduate Research Award for 2010 The senior in only his second year of study was selected for the high quality and innovative research he is pursing as an undergraduate in Professor Sanjay Kale s Parallel Programming Laboratory Illinois computer science student Edgar SolomonikIllinois computer science student Edgar Solomonik The award recognizes undergraduate students in North American universities who show outstanding research potential in an area of computing research according to the CRA Web site Edgar s research interests are in cross disciplinary work in parallel and high performance computing His current activities include improving a highly scalable parallel sorting algorithm and developing a new benchmark for molecular dynamics He is also working on a new collective communication strategy inside the parallel programming system Charm as well as helping develop a new parallel decomposition scheme for ChaNGa a computational astronomy code Scaling is a commonly used procedure with a wide breadth of applications in the high performance computing field Solomonik is the creator of a scalable extension of the Histogram Sorting method making fundamental modifications to the original algorithm in order to minimize message contention and exploit overlap His paper on the work Highly Scalable Parallel Sorting was accepted for the 2010 IPDPS IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Efficiently scaling parallel sorting on machines of this magnitude is inhibited by the communication intensive problem of migrating large amounts of data between processors said Solomonik The challenge is to design a highly scalable sorting algorithm that uses minimal communication maximizes overlap between computation and communication and uses memory efficiently According to Kale the cross disciplinary work that Solomonik conducts is important to many of the parallel and high performance computing advances the Illinois Parallel Programming Lab is making Solomonik s contributions are important to Charm a machine independent parallel programming system developed at Illinois NAMD a parallel object oriented molecular dynamics code designed for high performance simulation of large biomolecular systems and a computational astronomy code called ChaNGa Edgar is an exceptional student Sanjay Kale the head of PPL stated It is one thing to finish his BS in two years but to do the level of publishable research along with that is truly remarkable He is a valuable member of my research group I think he is a budding star Solomonik won the CS department Undergraduate Research Award last year as a freshman for an earlier version of his work on the Highly Scalable Parallel Sorting Solomonik s honor is the second time in the last two years that an undergraduate student from the Parallel Programming Lab has been recognized by the CRA Outstanding Undergraduate Research program and the fourth for an Illinois computer science student in the past 3 years Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Instagram Contact Us

Computer Science Visionary Scholarship Donors HomeAboutAwardsFaculty AwardsChairs and Professorships Donald B Gillies Professorship in Computer Science Donald Gillies The Donald B Gillies Chair in Computer Science honors the late Professor Gillies 1928 1975 who was a member of the faculty in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign from 1956 to 1975 Gillies earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Toronto in Canada in 1949 and his Ph D from Princeton University in 1953 At Princeton Gillies worked as a research assistant to John Von Neumann a pioneer of the modern digital computer He was among the first mathematicians to become involved in the computer field helping to calculate the first Sputnik orbit and later discovering three new prime numbers in the course of checking out ILLIAC II Professor Gillies was an inspiration to his students Long before the personal computer made hands on computer experience commonplace he recognized the need for students to have this opportunity and implemented several systems to provide it Throughout his work and teaching Gillies stressed the importance of the ethical use of computing machines in contemporary society He was dedicated to the honest uses of technology environmentally concerned a man of wit vigor and understanding Gillies challenged and stimulated those who knew him Lawrence Larry White established the Donald B Gillies Endowed Faculty Positions in Computer Science Fund in 1999 with a gift of 2 million White launched his programming career almost as soon as he got to college While working on his degrees at Illinois he spent four years as a student programmer on the PLATO project White graduated with a master s degree in computer science in 1976 after having earned his bachelor s degree in math and computer science the previous year After graduation White stayed on at Illinois eventually joining NCSA as a development manager In the 1990s he moved to Microsoft joining the Exchange Server and SQL Server groups Professor Gillies demonstrated tremendous enthusiasm for everything related to computers and a willingness to lead us his students into his world said White He acted like sharing his breadth of knowledge was a delight Even though I ve forgotten everything that was on the tests I ve never forgotten what it means to be a good teacher

bequest from the late Helen Eva Bliss in memory of her father Abel Bliss Jr Miss Bliss graduated from the University of Illinois in 1911 with a degree in Liberal Arts and Sciences Early in her career she taught engineering at a Shreveport Louisiana high school and later did clerical work with the Bureau of Aircraft Production in Washington D C From 1936 until her retirement in 1962 she worked for the Washington law firm of Ivins Phillips Barker as an executive secretary Abel Bliss Jr entered the University in 1872 to study civil engineering but was forced to leave the University before completing his degree In June of 1874 the University granted him a partial certificate in civil engineering His business ventures included agriculture and real estate and by 1929 he was a partner in the land development and oil production company of Bliss Wetherbee Mr Bliss died in the mid 1930s A portion of the Bliss bequest went to support the Grainger Engineering Library and Information Center

Computer Science Visionary Scholarship Donors HomeAboutAwardsFaculty AwardsChairs and Professorships Donald B Gillies Chair in Computer Science Donald Gillies The Donald B Gillies Chair in Computer Science honors the late Professor Gillies 1928 1975 who was a member of the faculty in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign from 1956 to 1975 Gillies earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Toronto in Canada in 1949 and his Ph D from Princeton University in 1953 At Princeton Gillies worked as a research assistant to John Von Neumann a pioneer of the modern digital computer He was among the first mathematicians to become involved in the computer field helping to calculate the first Sputnik orbit and later discovering three new prime numbers in the course of checking out ILLIAC II Professor Gillies was an inspiration to his students Long before the personal computer made hands on computer experience commonplace he recognized the need for students to have this opportunity and implemented several systems to provide it Throughout his work and teaching Gillies stressed the importance of the ethical use of computing machines in contemporary society He was dedicated to the honest uses of technology environmentally concerned a man of wit vigor and understanding Gillies challenged and stimulated those who knew him Lawrence Larry White established the Donald B Gillies Endowed Faculty Positions in Computer Science Fund in 1999 with a gift of 2 million White launched his programming career almost as soon as he got to college While working on his degrees at Illinois he spent four years as a student programmer on the PLATO project White graduated with a master s degree in computer science in 1976 after having earned his bachelor s degree in math and computer science the previous year After graduation White stayed on at Illinois eventually joining NCSA as a development manager In the 1990s he moved to Microsoft joining the Exchange Server and SQL Server groups Professor Gillies demonstrated tremendous enthusiasm for everything related to computers and a willingness to lead us his students into his world said White He acted like sharing his breadth of knowledge was a delight Even though I ve forgotten everything that was on the tests I ve never forgotten what it means to be a good teacher Recipients Lui

Algorithms Group at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque NM she joined the Computer and Information Sciences Department faculty at the University of Pennsylvania Tandy joined the faculty at the University of Texas in 1998 where she was the David Bruton Jr Centennial Professor of Computer Science She joined the Uniersity of Illinois at Urbana Champaign as a Founder Professor of Engineering and is now Associate Head for Computer Science she also has affiliate faculty appointments in s Bioengineering Electrical and Computer Engineering Mathematics Statistics and several biology departments Awards She received the National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award in 1994 the David and Lucile Packard Foundation Award in Science and Engineering in 1996 a Radcliffe Institute Fellowship in 2006 and a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship for 2011 She was elected a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery ACM in 2015 and of the International Society for Computational Biology ISCB in 2017 Teaching At the undergraduate level Warnow teaches courses in discrete mathematics and algorithm design and analysis and use problems from computational biology to demonstrate the applications of these skills and techniques to real world problems At the graduate level Warnow teaches CS 581 Algorithmic Computational Genomics The main focus of CS 581 is on phylogeny evolutionary tree estimation but the course also covers the related problems of computing multiple sequence alignments genome assembly and analyzing microbiomes Students will learn the mathematical and computational foundations in these areas read the current literature and do a team research project The techniques involved include discrete algorithms graph theory simulations and probabilistic analysis of algorithms Course website http tandy cs illinois edu 581 2018 html Leadership roles Warnow has had several leadership roles in international consortia including Genome 10K the Avian Phylogenomics Project and the Thousand Plant Transcriptome Initiative She was also the Director of the CIPRES Cyber Infrastructure for Phylogenetics Research project funded by a large ITR grant from NSF which had more than 10 universities around the country trained more than 50 PhD students including many of the computer scientists now working in computational biology and led to the establishment of the CIPRES Gateway She also chaired the NIH study section for Biodata Management and Analysis BDMA and was the main program officer at NSF for the BIg Data solicitation Research contributions Warnow s main research is in algorithms for statistical estimation problems in computatiional biology and historical linguistics Among her major contributions are SATe PASTA and UPP three different methods for multiple sequence alignment that provide high accuracy on large datasets up to 1 000 000 sequences She also contributed ASTRAL a method for species tree estimation from multi gene datasets that provides high accuracy in the presence of gene tree heterogeneity due to incomplete lineage sorting ASTRAL is now the dominant method for species tree estimation on large datasets that provides statistical guarantees i e statistical consistency under the multi species coalescent model Another major contribution was the development of the short quartet methods with Peter Erdos Laszlo Szekely and Mike Steel for phylogeny estimation which provided the first methods with polynomial sample complexity for phylogeny estimation Warnow also developed a phylogenetically based ensemble method using profile Hidden Markov Models that improves accuracy both precision and recall for a number of different bioinformatics problems including protein sequence classification metagenomic taxon identification and ultra large multiple sequence alignment Finally Warnow s collaboration with linguist Don Ringe Univ of Pennsylvania led to a rigorous approach to inferring evolutionary histories both trees and networks for natural languages and settled several outstanding conjectures for Indo European Current research Warnow s current work is developing novel machine learning and statistical learning approaches for large scale phylogenomics i e species tree estimation using genome scale datasets metagenomics protein classification and bibliometrics An exciting new development in her lab is the divide and conquer approach using Disjoint Tree Merger methods that enable computationally intensive methods to scale to large datasets The best of these methods e g TreeMerge and GTM are the work of her current PhD students and have been shown to dramatically reduce running time without reducing accuracy Research Areas Artificial Intelligence Bioinformatics and Computational Biology

Computer Science Visionary Scholarship Donors HomeNews Illinois CS Vision Group Provides Leadership in a Rapidly Growing Field 3 14 2019 2 47 21 PM By David Mercer Illinois Computer Science In less than a decade driven by the deep learning revolution computer vision has boomed and begun to transform photography social and interactive computing manufacturing health care construction industry agriculture and other fields Illinois Computer Science s three vision professors and their widening network of alumni are among the leaders drivProfessor David Forsyth left and Associate Professors Svetlana Lazebnik front and Derek Hoiem give Illinois Computer Science deep influence in the field of computer vision ing and shaping that growth Professor David Forsyth and Associate Professors Derek Hoiem and Svetlana Lazebnik lead Illinois Computer Science s Vision Group and play as Forsyth says a significant role in the academic computer vision community A decent fraction of the establishment is sitting in this room Forsyth said during an interview with the three of them in his office The concentration of people here is most unusual Most universities have zero or one people in the vision establishment We have three Between them they re responsible for a large and growing network of graduates who hold Illinois Computer Science PhDs and exert their own influence on how computer vision is being used and the research that is driving it The computer vision faculty s own research covers a wide range from Forsyth s work on everything from recognition to image synthesis and manipulation to Lazebnik s recent work has focused on joint models for image language understanding and Hoiem s groundbreaking work on creating 3D scene models from single photographs Through his research Hoiem has a foot squarely in industry too Reconstruct the startup he cofounded and for which he is CTO uses computer vision to create 3 D modeling for construction project management Conference Leadership The three professors are also taking leadership roles in another key area that brings the field together conferences All three have or are serving in organizing roles for major conferences in 2018 and this year Hoiem is a program chair this year s IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition CVPR and Forsyth filled the same role last year Forsyth is general chair for this year s International Conference on Computer Vision ICCV while Lazebnik is a program chair Leadership roles in major computer vision conferences such as the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition are a measure of the influence of Illinois CS vision professors In his role with CVPR last year Forsyth also was part of a group that put together what he believes is a first of its kind code of conduct He says the code was created after hearing about female graduate students leaving another conference because they were uncomfortable over attendee behavior That is something we simply cannot have he said explaining that with the code came a formal set of procedures to follow if there were future problems We didn t produce a code of conduct because of flourishing evil behavior in the vison community We needed to know what to do if something happened The conferences provide a key data point in measuring just how much the field has grown More than 6 100 people attended CVPR 2018 roughly triple the 2 000 who attended the 2014 version of the conference and about six times the number who were there in 2009 And the gathering is on track to be even bigger this year 5 165 papers were submitted by the November deadline a 56 percent increase over 2018 The growth in our conferences has been exponential Lazebnik said The Origin of Vision s Growth An article in Arstechnica traces the explosive growth in computer vision to essentially a moment in 2012 and Forsyth Lazebnik and Hoiem generally agree the publication of a paper introducing AlexNet a deep convolutional neural network designed by Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever then PhD students at the University of Toronto They used AlexNet to significantly outperform their competitors at identifying and classifying objects in the ImageNet competition Hoiem remembers exactly where he was when he and others heard the news at the European Conference on Computer Vision in Florence Italy I still remember outside of some cathedral that was part of the event and everybody was discussing Does this mean that there s a huge breakthrough But everybody knew that it was a really significant moment Hoiem said That was that kind of very visible moment when they broke through and outperformed the state of the art Lazebnik said And this was basically the start of the gold rush in deep learning Hoiem added that computer vision s growth has also been accelerated by the ease with which anyone can experiment with deep neural networks It became possible for a high schooler to download code from Github and train a recognition algorithm and get good results he said Some students applying for admission to Illinois CS now have already done high school projects that rely on computer vision that would not have been possible even five or six years ago And the demand for classes reflects how many students are interested in the field The introductory graduate level computer vision class CS543 had fewer than 50 students in 2012 This spring more than 250 students are enrolled Research LeadershipAssociate Professor Derek Hoiem is a co founder and CTO of Reconstruct The firm uses his research in 3D modeling for construction management In his career Forsyth s has explored the modeling of shading and illumination human animation user interfaces and more With former Illinois CS Professor Jean Ponce in 2003 he also co authored a now classic computer vision textbook Computer Vision A Modern Approach And in 2017 he authored a Probability and Statistics for Computer Science Now another textbook Applied Machine Learning is in press Lazebnik s work on models for image language understanding has benefitted applications like text based image search automatic image captioning visual question answering and visual dialog Hoiem s 3D modeling work is part of broader influential research on how computers can understand the space and shapes of objects and scenes from images Hoiem and Forsyth also collaborated closely on representing parts materials and shape of objects and placing synthetic objects into existing photos with natural lighting and shadows Influence of Vision Alumni Students who have graduated from Illinois CS are helping shape the future of computer vision through their own research and teaching and say their links back to the department remain influential Even today I m still learning from Forsyth I actually still speak to him a few times a year said Ali Farhadi PhD 11 He is the senior research manager for the Computer Vision Group at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence and an associate professor in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington Farhadi led recent research at the Allen Institute that pairs a human player with an AI program in a game he and others believe could push machine learning beyond its current limits Lazebnik PhD CS 06 is an alumnae too working as an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill before joining the Illinois CS faculty in 2012 Other Illinois CS graduates leading computer vision s growth include Brett Jones BS CS 08 MS 10 PhD 15 Kevin Karsch PhD CS 15 and Raj Sodhi BS CS 08 MS 10 PhD 15 the founders of Lightform a startup they created as PhD students that uses projection mapping to turn any object into an interactive display All three were advised by Forsyth while Professor Brian Bailey co advised Jones and Sodhi Gang Wang PhD ECE 10 a researcher and senior director at Alibaba and chief scientist of Alibaba AI Labs MIT Technology Review in 2017 named him one of its 35 Innovators Under 35 He was advised by Forsyth and Hoiem Steve Sullivan MS ECE 90 PhD ECE 96 general manager of Microsoft s Mixed Reality Capture Studios and formerly of Lucasfilm where he contributed to more than 70 films and won three Academy Awards for Technology Advised like Lazebnik by former Illinois Professor Jean Ponce Yasutaka Furukawa PhD CS 08 who is an assistant professor at Simon Fraser University with a long track record of 3D vision research including his multi view stereo algorithm to construct detailed 3D models from images His software has been used by Industrial Light and Magic He too was advised by Ponce Ease of Access The access to faculty that students find at Illinois Computer Science is another thing that sets the Vision Group apart according to Forsyth Lazebnik and Hoiem They say they work hard to be accessible to their students in a way they suspect might not be found on some campuses Forsyth pointed out that before gathering to discuss the Vision Group he came to his office early and a student noticed the open door and stopped by to talk We spent 20 minutes And it was interesting and useful for both of us Forsyth said It creates an attractive and valuable environment for students to speak with people who really know what they re doing without having to wait through six months worth of email to set up an appointment Facebook Twitter YouTube

5 2018 1 38 03 PM David Mercer Illinois Computer Science CS ILLINOIS Professor Tarek Abdelzaher is leading a group of researchers studying how information propagates through social media and the effects that information has on people s beliefs as it moves The project started in late 2017 when the group was awarded a five year 4 million grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or DARPA under its SocialSim program The spread of information by social media and how it shapes the understanding of events and even influences their outcomes has been a hot button topic in many major news stories the past few years from the influence of terrorist groups such as ISIS to the 2016 presidential election Professor and Willett Faculty Scholar Tarek Abdelzaher How do we react to events Are social media creating echo chambers where we only hear what people who will think like us say or do we become more accepting of other people s beliefs Abdelzaher said articulating key questions he hopes to address There are some fundamental questions about societies and information that we can answer by doing this research Abdelzaher is leading the work joined by Abel Bliss Professor of Engineering Jiawei Han David Nicol who is the Franklin W Woeltge Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Director of the U of I s Information Trust Institute and Professors Boleslaw Szymanski and Gyorgy Korniss at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Szymanski and Korniss are known for their accomplishments in social network modeling and analysis Abdelzaher says the project brings together Han s expertise in data mining Nicol s extensive knowledge of high speed simulation and his own deep experience with embedded systems together with RPI s social network modeling expertise They plan to create a tool called Social Cube to model analyze and simulate social media information propagation and how it both affects and is affected by people s beliefs Much like you might detect and track a tank moving through a field or a river valley by the sound it creates and the vibrations that propagate from the tank through the ground the team will model the reverberations caused by information as it travels through a platform such as Twitter to develop the new information physics An event happens and a response propagates through social media Abdelzaher said And I want to study it the way we studied sound the way we studied vibrations It s just a new type of signal propagating in a new type of medium A number of factors have to be understood in order to model how people behave as information relays moving those signals everything from the degree to which someone likes or agrees with a given piece of information how much they trust the source of the information and whether those and other factors make it more or less likely that the person consuming that information will share it with others Abdelzaher said Professor David NicolNicol will apply his experience in assessing the reliability of the simulations used in that analysis I am interested in developing means of assessing how trustworthy these models are in capturing characteristics of information propagation Nicol said The challenge is that the causes of this propagation might be unseen For example communication between people by cellphone not captured in social media Yet that communication can affect behavior and those effects will be seen in the data from which the models are derived And Han will provide the means of sifting the vast amounts of data that are the project s raw material Professor Jiawei Han I hope to develop new technologies to mine phrases from text recognize entities and relationships from social media and build a dual structure a heterogeneous information network and a multi dimensional text cube to facilitate Social Cube analysis Han said Abdelzaher s team began by modeling information spread on Twitter and Instagram and will work on modeling other platforms Abdelzaher says he has long been fascinated by the way social media is fundamentally changing the ways people communicate in giving anyone the ability to spread their ideas but also the ability to both find others with similar ideas and block or ignore anything that may be unfamiliar or uncomfortable People have started filtering information differently people have started finding other people who think like them How is that affecting how information spreads he asked We want to study that how do beliefs form in that future where social media rule How do they collide How do they stabilize I think those are fundamental very very interesting questions about that new reality that didn t exist 10 years ago Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Instagram Contact Us

Computer Science Visionary Scholarship Donors HomeNews Illinois receives 25 million to develop Internet of Battlefield Things 10 3 2017 3 30 49 PM On the battlefields of tomorrow humans and technology will work together in a seamless cohesive network giving soldiers a competitive edge and keeping troops and civilians out of harm s way The University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign has been selected to lead a 25 million initiative to develop the scientific foundations of a next generation Internet of Battlefield Things IoBT designed to enable new predictive battlefield analytics and services The Alliance for IoBT Research on Evolving Intelligent Goal driven Networks IoBT REIGN funded by the Army Research Laboratory ARL includes collaborators from ARL Carnegie Mellon University University of California Berkeley University of California Los Angeles University of Massachusetts University of Southern California and SRI International The funding covers the first five years of a potential 10 year effort Tarek AbdelzaherIn the future military operations will rely less on human soldiers and more on interconnected technology leveraging advancements in unmanned systems and machine intelligence in order to achieve superior defense capabilities The IoBT will connect soldiers with smart technology in armor radios weapons and other objects to give troops extra sensory perception offer situational understanding endow fighters with prediction powers provide better risk assessment and develop shared intuitions This award enables a true collaboration between researchers at ARL and researchers in academia and industry to change the status quo in smart battlefield services said Tarek Abdelzaher the academic lead of the Alliance and a professor of computer science at Illinois Through ARL s Collaborative Research Alliance model we can change our fundamental understanding of what s possible when computers sensors data weapons soldiers wearables and media analytics are networked to empower new defense capabilities In a battle environment human operators must adapt to unexpected changes IoBT researchers aim to create a cyber network of things that adapt as the mission evolves That means that a system will have to analyze its available resources and re assemble itself to best meet requirements for the present execution In addition these systems must be self aware and able to reason about their goals state vulnerabilities and other characteristics in order to meet a commander s intent They have to be able to counteract and mitigate disruptions and attacks in near real time and provide stability under uncertain conditions The IoBT system must also have cognitive abilities and be able to fuse data from technology with data from humans It will have to function in a continuous state of learning at multiple time scales for example learning from previous actions while acting in the present and anticipating future moves As a result the system will be able to provide commanders with the most relevant information at any given time While commercial IoTs provide some of this capability it is not challenged in the same manner as on the battlefield said Dr Stephen Russell ARL s Battlefield Information Processing Branch Chief and the government lead of the Alliance The B in the IoBT is a key focus These activities must be reliable and should appropriately leverage all networks blue gray and red which have varying degrees of trustworthiness Blue are secure and military owned networks gray are often civilian networks with uncertain trustworthiness and red are adversarial networks This effort to understand and exploit the unique capabilities of networked battlefield systems is an interdisciplinary problem that brings together researchers in cyber physical computing information theory security formal methods machine learning networking control and cognitive science among other disciplines An integral part of the alliance is the collaboration between ARL and the academic and industry researchers Illinois is proud to lead this effort which will not only advance military science but also could lead to breakthroughs that impact many other fields said Andreas Cangellaris Dean of Illinois College of Engineering The excellence brought forth by this team could transform 21st century technology Facebook Twitter YouTube

HomeNews DARPA JUMP Center Aims to Define the Future of Microelectronics 6 12 2018 11 14 29 AM Tom Hanlon ECE ILLINOIS For such a tiny part the transistor plays a huge role in our lives Transistors invented in 1947 by former ECE ILLINOIS Professor John Bardeen and two other physicists have helped usher in the information revolution They are ubiquitous in technology Their low cost flexibility and reliability have allowed for amazing advancements in computers machines equipment products anything that involves microelectronics And those advancements have been incremental throughout the years Consider this Intel s 22nm 3D transistors introduced in 2011 run over 4 000 times as fast as Intel s first microprocessor introduced in 1971 They use about 5 000 times less energy and their price per transistor dropped by a factor of about 50 000 The company manufactures more than 5 billion transistors every second That adds up to incredible speed at very affordable costs which translates to ever improving technology There is only one catch but it is a big one It is embodied in Moore s law which projects that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles every two years THE PROBLEM ECE ILLINOIS Professor Wen Mei Hwu The overarching problem is the semiconducting industry has been on a scaling path for almost 50 years says ECE ILLINOIS Professor Wen Mei W Hwu who is an affiliate of Illinois Computer Science and the Coordinated Science Lab But he believes the pace of advancement based on this scaling process is coming to an end soon because as the transistors get smaller and smaller the process has become way too expensive Hwu adds In other words you can shrink transistors only so far Then you need to look for advancements in other ways This is the focus of a 3 75 million grant awarded to the University of Illinois to be part of a team conducting research to increase the performance efficiency and capabilities of electronics systems for both military and commercial applications John Bardeen started a revolution in the microelectronics industry And Hwu Illinois Computer Science Professor Sarita V Adve and ECE ILLINOIS Associate Professor Nam Sung Kim are tasked with helping to take that revolution to a higher level JUMP CENTERS First announced earlier this year the team s work is funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA and U S industry participants Overall funding for the program called JUMP the Joint University Microelectronics Program exceeds 150 million and has resulted in a collaborative network of six research centers spread across the country The Illinois contingency headed by Adve Hwu and Kim comprises part of one of two horizontal centers for the project Those two centers will intersect with four vertical centers ECE ILLINOIS Associate Professor Nam Sung Kim We are an Applications Driving Architectures Center says Kim who is an affiliate of Illinois Computer Science and the Coordinated Science Lab A key role of our center is to synergistically put all the activities of other vertical centers together so we can cost effectively produce efficient integrated systems for future computing applications We are bringing all these pieces together to get the maximum benefit out of the individual centers efforts The Applications Driving Architectures ADA Center is developing circuits and architectures to implement computation communication and storage applications and support the needs of the four vertical centers which are studying RF to terahertz sensors and communication systems distributed computing and networking cognitive computing and intelligent memory and storage The ADA Center formally began in January and is on a three year renewable contract Other institutions making up the ADA Center include Stanford MIT UC Berkeley Michigan Washington Princeton and Harvard The horizontal centers function to Drive foundational developments in a specific discipline or a set of like minded disciplines Build expertise in and around key disciplinary building blocks Create disruptive breakthroughs in areas of interest to JUMP sponsors Define a set of key metrics that they will use to benchmark and drive efforts in the defined research space I am a strong believer of long term research Adve says All of my projects last many years I tell my students it s a story that you re unfolding When I think about my work over the last 20 years I think of it as a sequence of chapters in a story where each chapter makes an impact that builds on the previous one To that end JUMP is eyeing an 8 to 12 year research time frame that will lead to defense and commercial opportunities from 2025 to 2030 THE CHALLENGES Illinois Computer Science Professor Sarita V AdveThe Illinois team and the program in general faces many challenges Among them are Balancing the need to build customized systems with the need to generalize those systems for greatest possible use among applications There are so many applications out there we cannot design something for every application Adve says Kim agrees Customizing hardware for different applications becomes very expensive he says So one of the objectives of our center is to provide building blocks to make a specialized process that operates in a more efficient manner Specifying software at a higher level The software should be synthesized so instead of people writing every line of code for each level of software the software should be specified at the higher level more at the algorithm level Hwu says Increasing efficiency We need to think about how we can compress things into fewer operations do less work to get higher efficiency Hwu says One of the things Nam Sung and I have been working on is lowering the system overhead by making the entire data always be in the main memory Data movement Adve agrees is highly inefficient Let s say I have a self driving car she says It has many different components I might want to specialize the computation of each of these components but they have to communicate data with each other How do I connect these specialized components together so that they form a whole system with minimal overheads in communication You need efficient interfaces Improving the interface between hardware and software The interface for communicating data between different components of a system is becoming a real source of inefficiency Adve says In the past when we had general purpose systems everything ran on pretty much the same interface But when you design something to be so general purpose to be everything for everybody it cannot be efficient for everything We are designing the data communication interfaces and protocols for the next generation of specialized systems Working without prototypes The applications are changing so system design follows a moving target Adve says It s very hard to do this kind of research without building prototypes but building prototypes is hard especially in hardware Redeveloping libraries Software rely on libraries Hwu says These libraries need to be redeveloped and retuned for each type of hardware Right now there s a vacuum in the industry in terms of how library functions in the future will be able to keep up with the hardware ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS Hwu whose career as an undergraduate student graduate student and professor spans 40 years has seen gradual changes in computer architecture over that time It has been an extremely slow evolution he says but now we re seeing a very dramatic change When the industry is going through slow evolution you can take the current generation of hardware and change some of the software and do some experiments and then predict some of the benefits for making some small changes in the next generation But when things start to be so different you start to lose that kind of trajectory In previous generations improvements were easier Hwu says You had a lot more transistors to play with and their power efficiency was getting better so from an architect s point of view we didn t have to make dramatic changes he says Now we need to think about how we organize the devices that we have to get better transistor energy efficiency Adve agrees A huge part of computer performance improvement is going to come from how computer architects can organize these devices and expose them to the program she says In the past computer architects were wildly successful in that they defined a general interface the basic instructions that computers execute That she says enabled a lot of innovation in the hardware because we knew these were the instructions we had to design to and the hardware designers were free to innovate as long as the hardware would execute these instructions TAKING THE WORK TO THE NEXT LEVEL One of the key target applications are artificial intelligence AI apps which are used extensively in society today in medicine finance healthcare education transportation heavy industry the military aviation telecommunications and many more industries All the innovations in these industries rely on computer technology Kim says We are enabling these innovations for our everyday lives Hwu jokingly compares their work to that of plumbers We are providing the foundation the infrastructure for people to build safer vehicles to build better education for students to be able to understand financial risks better he says We won t take a lot of the top level application glories but we will make sure that they can still have the glories Both Hwu and Adve were involved in what Hwu calls the previous generation of the ADA Center C FAR Center for Future Architectures Research A good chunk of the software synthesis that we re doing here was also supported by C FAR Hwu says The C FAR work laid the foundation for this work and increases our confidence that we can meet the challenges adds Adve In C FAR we were working on understanding what the issues were Now we are taking that work to the next level I EXPECT A BETTER WORLD The project involves a number of graduate students as well The students get great exposure Adve says They go to these center meetings and interact with some of the best people in the industry and work collaboratively with them It s a great experience for students Hwu and Kim s students are building prototype software hardware and libraries It s hard work Hwu says The amount of time it takes them to complete their theses is even more uncertain So how we support our students as they take on these high risk systems construction work that can have a lot of land mines that keeps us thinking Getting to that next level offers a lot of hope for the future of the microelectronics industry though that future is murky at the moment Hwu says It s hard to say where we are going to be in five years he notes That s part of the research A lot of the future is defined in the process I think this research can be a game changer Adve says This industry is at a point right now where the path is really not clear This is a huge opportunity for us It might even be a once in a lifetime chance to influence in a big way where the industry goes Everything that we do today will get connected by this technology So what do I expect to see at the end of this research I expect a better world See

Specialized and Reconfigurable Hardware 7 28 2018 3 42 33 PM Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency The general purpose computer has remained the dominant computing architecture for the last 50 years driven largely by the relentless pace of Moore s Law the transistor scaling that has allowed for a half century of rapid progress in electronics As this trajectory slows however it has become increasingly more challenging to achieve performance gains from generalized hardware setting the stage for a resurgence in specialized architectures Professor Sarita AdveThe program managers behind DARPA s Electronics Resurgence Initiative ERI have selected research teams from academia including the University of Illinois Department of Computer Science and industry to explore the development of flexible architectures capable of using specialized hardware to solve specific computing problems more quickly and efficiently ERI is a five year upwards of 1 5 billion investment to jumpstart innovation in the electronics industry As a part of the ERI Architectures research thrust area Illinois Computer Science Professor Sarita Adve Professor and Interim Head of Department Vikram Adve and Assistant Professor Sasa Misailovic are part of the research teams selected for the Domain specific System on Chip DSSoC program along with research teams from IBM Oak Ridge National Labs Arizona State University and Stanford University Professor Vikram AdveAssistant Professor Christopher Fletcher is part of the teams chosen for the Software Defined Hardware SDH program which also includes Intel NVIDIA Qualcomm and STR as well as Georgia Tech University Stanford University the University of Michigan University of Washington and Princeton University The SDH and DSSoC programs will explore new ways to co optimize software and hardware without requiring more complex programming Both programs seek to prove that there need not be a continued tradeoff between efficiency and flexibility the hallmark of general purpose processors Assistant Professor Christopher FletcherIllinois researchers involved in the DSSoC group say they will be working to design cognitive heterogeneous systems that will underlie products such as smart connected vehicles The Illinois team is an ideal reflection of the goals of the project develop systems that combine the programmability of general purpose computers with the hardware efficiency of specialized systems Sarita Adve Vikram Adve and Sasa Misailovic said in a statement Our team s expertise spans hardware and software with past contributions that include the LLVM compiler the Java and C memory models and seminal work on approximate computing For the DSSOC project we will lead the design of the software compilation stack and the memory system architecture they added As Moore s Law ends this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to influence an entire industry that is looking for novel ways to sustain the computing performance improvements we have come to expect Assistant Professor Sasa MisailovicThe first domain that DSSoC researchers will explore is software defined radio a technology with roles in mobile and satellite communications personal area networks radar and electronic warfare It is critical for the DoD to have flexible adaptable radio systems that are capable of managing and combating a complex signal environment said Tom Rondeau the Microsystems Technology Office program manager leading DSSoC These devices must be programmable like general purpose processors but also capable of crunching a lot of math with low power The concept of mixing processor cores to achieve a needed level of specialization is an exciting prospect but without the ability to enable the developer to program for these devices their utility is limited DSSoC is looking to address the right levels of heterogeneous processing while simultaneously focusing on the software tools and supporting the developer ecosystem surrounding software defined radio initially and expanding beyond that throughout the program The SDH program which Fletcher is part of aims to develop hardware and software that can be reconfigured in real time based on the data being processed adapting the computing architecture for the workload and data at hand To achieve this goal researchers will explore reconfigurable computing architectures and software environments that can deliver specialized data intensive application performance without sacrificing versatility or programmability and without the need to develop specialized circuits for each application If successful SDH could open a pathway to data intensive algorithms that can run at very low cost The ability to understand data and predict the world around us delivers a fundamental advantage for human nature and can lead to an asymmetric advantage for the DoD said Wade Shen the program manager leading SDH who bridges the gap between hardware and software by working across DARPA s Microsystems Technology Office and Information Innovation Office For problems that cannot afford the large investment required for fully custom solutions we currently sacrifice compute efficiency by implementing solutions in the form of software on general purpose processors or field programmable gate arrays FPGAs Often this results in application implementations that are thousands of times worse than optimal SDH will develop runtime reconfigurable hardware and software that enables near full custom performance without sacrificing programmability for data intensive algorithms SDH and DSSoC are two of six ERI Page 3 programs so named for their relevance to the guidance shared by Gordon Moore on the third page of his seminal 1965 research paper that articulated what became known as Moore s Law Designed to fulfill the post scaling predictions made by Moore the ERI Page 3 Architectures programs seek to determine whether we can enjoy the benefits of specialized and application reconfigurable circuitry while still relying on general programming constructs through integrated software hardware co design Other University of Illinois researchers are also part of the DARPA ERI awards announced July 23 during the first DARPA ERI Summit in San Francisco They include a grant to develop foundational computing technology for next generation autonomous defense systems being led by Professor Naresh Shanbhag of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Illinois and a researcher in the Coordinated Science Lab The three day DARPA conference brought together hundreds of members of the electronics community to explore the future of the industry and its impact on national defense Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Instagram

HomeNews New Algorithm Fuses Quality And Quantity In Satellite Imagery 6 4 2018 2 22 27 PM By Lois Yoksoulian Illinois News Bureau Using a new algorithm University of Illinois researchers may have found the solution to an age old dilemma plaguing satellite imagery whether to sacrifice high spatial resolution in the interest of generating images more frequently or vice versa The team s new tool eliminates this trade off by fusing high resolution and high frequency satellite data into one integrated product and can generate 30 meter daily continuous images going back to the year 2000 Monitoring of agriculture urban development environmental quality and economic development are just a few ways people make use of satellite data The new algorithm is generic enough for use in virtually any application Natural Resources Environmental Sciences Assistant Professor Kaiyu Guan left graduate student Yunan Luo and CS Assistant Professor Jian Peng have developed a new algorithm that solves an age old dilemma plaguing satellite imagery whether to sacrifice high spatial resolution in the interest of generating images more frequently or vice versa Their algorithm can generate daily continuous images going back to the year 2000 Photo by L Brian Stauffer In agricultural applications imaging at 10 to 30 meter resolution is critical for farmers to see field level rapid and subtle changes in crop conditions that affect yield such as crop stress and disturbance after extreme weather events Existing data have either insufficient spatial resolution or low frequency the researchers said Farmers usually require information with both high resolution and near real time occurrence We struggled to find public satellite data that has both high spatial resolution and high frequency in our own research it simply did not exist said natural resources and environmental sciences Assistant Professor and study co author Kaiyu Guan So we took the initiative to produce it ourselves Guan a Blue Waters professor at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at Illinois teamed up with CS Assistant Professor Jian Peng and graduate student Yunan Luo of computer science to develop an algorithm that fuses satellite images from multiple sources into continuous daily high resolution images The researchers describe their methodology and findings in the journal Remote Sensing of Environment We first ingested all of the available satellite data sets into Blue Waters the National Science Foundation s leadership class supercomputer With a click of a button to run our algorithm what automatically comes out are daily high resolution images available for all sorts of scientific applications Guan said Previous researchers have developed methods for fusing high resolution spatial and temporal data but these came with limitations Almost all of the algorithms lacked automation and could not simultaneously deal with missing pixels and temporal fusion These drawbacks led to short term and localized applications To overcome the limitations of previous methods the team designed the algorithm to automatically integrate information from existing data This compensates for missing information resulting from cloud coverage or data gaps The new algorithm can create images without any missing pixels for any site or region by leveraging time series information and relations with neighboring pixels In addition to near real time daily high resolution data collection the team envisions building long term daily continental scale images for various applications The type of high quality satellite data required to run this algorithm has been collected since 2000 meaning we can generate daily 30 meter resolution images for any location on this planet going back in time Guan said This can be used to study changes in agricultural productivity ecosystem and polar ice dynamics since 2000 in much higher detail than previously possible Peng said Our approach may revolutionize the use of satellite data The researchers have already successfully fused surface reflectance data in Champaign County Ill and generated daily time series for the growing season of 2017 at 30 meter resolution Even though others have invested in similar technology they could not go back in time like we can Guan said The data sources for our algorithms use the most rigorous data from NASA or the European Space Agency and produce daily fusion data that is ready for research and practical applications Guan said Generating this sort of data requires significant computing resources making accessibility difficult Peng said We want to share the output with the broader scientific community and we are working to find a way to make that possible NASA

29 2018 3 50 03 PM National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health and David Mercer Illinois Computer Science An international team of researchers that includes Illinois Computer Science PhD candidate Faraz Faghri and Professor Roy H Campbell has proven that mutations in the neuronal transport gene KIF5A are associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS The findings identify how mutations in KIF5A disrupt the transport of key proteins up and down long threadlike axons that connect nerve cells between the brain and the spine eventually leading to the neuromuscular symptoms of ALS Also known as Lou Gehrig s disease ALS is progressive and fatal often beginning with muscle twitching weakness in a limb or slurred speech The disease eventually affects control of the muscles needed to move speak eat and breathe PhD candidate Faraz Faghri says the massive data sets that were part of the study required new methods and computational environments The discovery published in the March 21 2018 issue of Neuron was led by Bryan Traynor of the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health and by John Landers of the University of Massachusetts Medical School Key funding support came from the NIA the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS at NIH and several public and private sector organizations The research effort required analyzing a massive amount of genetic data The NIH team performed a large scale genome wide association study while the University of Massachusetts team concentrated on analyzing rare variants in next generation sequence data More than 125 000 samples were used in this study making it by far the largest such study of ALS performed to date The extraordinary teamwork that went into this study underlines the value of global collaborative science as we seek to better understand devastating diseases like ALS said Dr Richard J Hodes director of NIA These types of collaborative data collection and analysis are important in identifying the pathways underlying disease and in developing approaches to treatment and prevention Faghri who works with Campbell and is a consultant to the NIH said the massive amount of data being analyzed required new approaches We developed new methods and computational environments for analyzing these large datasets Faghri said Achievement of the potential genetic and healthcare breakthroughs clearly requires new algorithms computational systems and disruptive data analysis methods Campbell added thaPaper featured on the cover of the March 21 2018 issue of Neuron The cover image shows neuronal axon transport going to the neuromuscular synapse Artwork by Ethan Tyler of the NIH Medical Arts Department t he was excited that computer science played such a key role This type of success encourages computer scientists to collaborate with the medical community to take advantage of the emerging big data and machine learning breakthroughs to offer new discoveries and enhance healthcare delivery he said KIF5A regulates proteins that serve as tiny intracellular motors Problems with these proteins are connected to ALS Parkinson s disease and Alzheimer s disease and were previously connected to some less common neurodegenerative diseases with muscle weakening stiffening and spasticity symptoms similar to ALS Axons extend from the brain to the bottom of the spine forming some of the longest single cellular pathways in the body Traynor said KIF5A helps to move key proteins and organelles specialized parts of cells up and down that axonal transport system controlling the engines for the nervous system s long range cargo trucks This mutation disrupts that system causing the symptoms we see with ALS Traynor cautioned that the discovery still leaves much more work to be done While this is unlikely to be a very common genetic cause for ALS it identifies important new directions to explore possible future gene therapies he said The paper https doi org 10 1016 j neuron 2018 02 027 Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Instagram Contact Us Thomas M Siebel Center for

2018 4 11 57 PM Mike Koon College of Engineering Since 2014 a group of Enginering faculty and staff that includes Computer Science Associate Professor Craig Zilles has been revolutionizing how students take exams and do homework with PrairieLearn a tool they created for online assessment This year through a Strategic Instructional Innovations Program SIIP grant the team is working to grow the number of courses using PrairieLearn with the goal of increasing its effectiveness and impact PrairieLearn allows students to take exams and do homework online at times convenient to them Questions are both randomized so every student is asked something unique and auto graded so every student gets instant feedback Questions also go far beyond multiple choice and true false Prairie Learn SIIP project team members l r Craig Zilles computer science Tim Bretl aerospace engineering and Matthew West mechanical science and engineering join Carleen Sacris front coordinator of the Computer Based Testing Facility at the CBTF lab Questions can involve writing code drawing schematics annotating diagrams moving three dimensional objects around the sky is the limit noted Tim Bretl associate professor of aerospace engineering and the PI on the SIIP project The auto grading that PrairieLearn enables has clear benefits to instructors We found with the larger TAM Theoretical and Applied Mechanics courses some of which have more than a thousand students each year we were drowning in grading said Matthew West associate professor of mechanical science and engineering and the creator of PrairieLearn We would also get complaints from students that their friend wrote the same thing as they did but got one more point By automating the process we made it much more efficient and assured that everyone was getting the same experience PrairieLearn has huge benefits for students as well Instead of grading TAs get to spend more time interacting with students West indicated PrairieLearn frees us up to add projects and other in depth creative activities to the course The immediate response that students get instead of waiting weeks for the results of hand grading is very important added Zilles a member of the SIIP project team This response need not be only whether an answer is right or wrong it can also come with an explanation of why Because questions are randomized students who need extra practice can get it from PrairieLearn I have had students take a practice exam six times in a row Zilles said They might get a 55 percent then a 65 then a 70 then an 80 They do it until they get it right and then take the exam It s great for everybody because I want to give good grades and I want them to learn the material PrairieLearn helps to make both things happen Going hand in hand with Prairie Learn is the advent of the Computer Based Testing Facility CBTF founded by West and Zilles The facility housed in the lower level of Grainger Engineering Library contains 80 computer stations and is open 12 hours per day Instead of taking exams at times that faculty choose students can sign up to take exams at the CBTF when it is most convenient for them Proctors are there to check IDs and administer the exams Instructors want exams taken in a secure environment West noted The CBTF doesn t allow students to talk to each other and prevents access to arbitrary websites The ability for students to self schedule and get immediate results is a key benefit The growth of both PrairieLearn and the CBTF has been impressive Between 2014 and 2017 the number of courses using them has grown from 1 to 22 the number of students impacted has grown from 200 to 6000 and the number of exams given has grown from 900 to over 50 000 per semester Because exams are easier to give instructors tend to give them more frequently cutting down on the pressure of each individual exam West said They can more easily give retakes and the whole process is more transparent to the students As part of the current SIIP grant the team is helping instructors get up to speed working with them to create content and holding office hours for support We have the infrastructure now to make this work at a large scale West said That took a lot of effort Now things are really taking off Even courses outside the College of Engineering have started to adopt PrairieLearn and although the team is currently focused on internal growth they anticipate sharing this tool with other universities The impact has already been tremendous Bretl concluded We have seen grades go up and have seen classes completely change for the better with a lot more meaningful interaction between students and instructors Our goal is to get PrairieLearn into the hands of as many other people as possible Let s see where it takes us Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Instagram Contact Us Thomas M Siebel Center for Computer Science 201 North Goodwin Avenue MC 258 Urbana IL 61801 2302 ph 217 333

Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign has received the 100 000 Grand Prize for the NCWIT Extension Services Transformation NEXT Award Sponsored by the National Center for Women Information Technology NCWIT and Google the NEXT Awards honor academic departments that show significant positive outcomes in increasing women s meaningful participation in computing education The Awards will be presented to past and present clients of NCWIT s Extension Services for Undergraduate Programs ES UP at this week s NCWIT Summit on Women and IT The week long Gems Computer Science Camp for Girls is designed to dazzle and delight middle and high school students by exposing them to the broad field of computing and its applications Photo Credit Priten Vora CS ILLINOIS is being recognized for its long term commitment to the recruitment and retention of undergraduate women In 2015 women earned 57 of all undergraduate degrees in the U S However women earned less than one fifth of all computer and information science undergraduate degrees Yet thanks to outreach and recruiting efforts like Gems Computer Science Camp for Girls ChicTech Girls Who Code Women in Computer Science WCS Visit Day and SAIL as well as efforts to eliminate the effects of implicit bias in admissions the fall 2016 CS ILLINOIS freshman class in Engineering was 46 female a record high Not only are we proud to recognize these departments for their remarkable results but we re also proud to recognize the ripple effect these institutions create among the computing community at large said NCWIT CEO and Co founder Lucy Sanders They are setting an example for other institutions reinventing their culture by establishing better habits and practices for attracting and keeping a range of students in their computing programs Computing touches nearly every field today from the arts and science to business medicine and engineering We want computing s remarkable opportunities to be available to everyone said CS Department Head Rob A Rutenbar The NCWIT NEXT Award Grand Prize is a fantastic acknowledgement of our efforts at Illinois to make the field more representative of the people around us and it will help us to continue to move forward The Department s work to improve pedagogy and culture was also acknowledged in the award citation Those efforts include hiring faculty in a new specialized Teaching Professor track to teach lower level courses requiring teaching assistants to take a semester long seminar on pedagogy increased opportunities for collaborative learning ongoing improvements to the introductory course sequence including the new Software Design Studio and strong support for student activities and department wide student social events The CS X family of collaborative bachelor s degree programs was also cited as yielding notable success in attracting undergraduate women CS X allows students to pursue a program of study combining a strong grounding in CS with technical or professional training in the arts and sciences Initially launched with four degrees CS Anthropology CS Astronomy CS Chemistry and CS Linguistics eleven additional CS X programs are currently under discussion In fact CS Crop Sciences and CS Music were approved by the Faculty Senate earlier this year Each degree is awaiting review by the University s Board of Trustees and the

Michael Woodley welcomes a new group of students to the 2 semester senior projects course CS 492 4 He invites the students to apply to work on projects with corporate clients or he matches them with projects for clients in the non profit sector Either way the students begin one of the most challenging yet valuable classes in their undergraduate career According to Woodley in eight short months the students will apply years of knowledge to solving a real world problem In the process they will have learned how to work with colleagues a typical project has four students define a problem develop and test a solution and communicate their progress to their client This past spring more than 140 students completed 30 projects the most ever in the course s 14 year history In April they presented their research results to clients faculty and fellow students at the Senior Projects Showcase in Siebel Center One of those projects SugarCUB3D taught children introductory programming concepts and then rewarded them by 3D printing their initials with icing on an Oreo cookie Other memorable projects over the years include real time facial recognition and memory software for Rockwell Collins a mobile app that enabled cancer patients undergoing treatment to easily schedule help from their friends with meals and other tasks and geographic information technology that converts map data into games Woodley encourages companies to consider sponsoring one or more projects especially since students interested in working for a corporate client submit their resumes as part of the matching process at the start of the course Interested in sponsoring a CS 492 4 course senior project Visit the Project Sponsor FAQ Page Contact Mike Woodley at mwoodley illinois edu Cost is 12 000 Course runs from late August until mid April Company representatives pitch their projects to all the enrolled students at the start of the fall semester After reviewing student resumes company reps
