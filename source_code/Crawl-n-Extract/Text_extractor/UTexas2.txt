LIU Sophomore Texas CS 2017 First Bytes was my first real experience with CS outside of high school and being in such a supportive environment with other girls from so many different backgrounds really made me believe I could succeed in the field and solidified my decision to pursue computer science Creating a project with a team of other girls gave me the opportunity to understand that CS is a challenging but rewarding field I also really enjoyed my visit to VMware a software company in Austin because it was the first time I was exposed to a working environment and I was able to picture myself in a similar setting a few years down the road JACQUELINE GIBSON Junior Texas CS 2017 First Bytes is an amazing experience for high school girls interested in studying CS As a former participant and later a Residential Assistant I ve been able to witness the transformative experience twice over It s amazing to see the ways that campers grow in confidence over the week working together in teams to program and develop a project of their own Girls have the ability to learn about the various facets of CS learning from expert researchers and industry professionals I can say confidently that First Bytes contributed to my decision to major in Computer Science and attend UT and I am thankful to have participated in worked with such a wonderful program DIVYA MANOHAR Freshman Texas CS 2017 Before attending First Bytes I knew I was interested in coding but was unaware of the applications of computer science as a career In just one week First Bytes exposed me to a multitude of career options involving CS including architecture the CIA and game design Being introduced to all these focuses got me thinking about my future occupation and motivated me to do research in topics

LinkedIn Search for content on UT News Search Button Education Leadership Nov 11 2020 Leaving Their Mark Two UT undergraduate leaders talk about the Department of Computer Science s new endowment and what it means for future students By Tracy Zhang This time this summer in the context of social change and everything things just finally fell into place said Audra Collins a computer science senior at The University of Texas at Austin Collins is president of the Association of Black Computer Scientists ABCS which seeks to create paths to educational and professional success for Black and other underrepresented students in this major Amid the pandemic earlier this year she met with fellow senior and close friend Am rica Quistiano She is president of the Hispanic Association of Computer Scientists HACS which has similar aims for Hispanic and Latinx students Together these two leaders drafted plans to bring about social change for students at the departmental level Black and Hispanic Latinx students have been historically underrepresented in STEM fields and today computer science is no different As the leaders of their respective organizations Collins and Quistiano saw firsthand how underserved and underrepresented students were personally affected Many of their members were the first in their families to pursue a technical degree or any degree at all and they were struggling in their high school to college transitions Meanwhile other members had to work multiple jobs on top of full time enrollment to support themselves financially Collins and Quistiano saw these challenges and wanted to help and support these students From left to right Audra Collins is president of the Association of Black Computer Scientists ABCS Am rica Quistiano is president of the Hispanic Association of Computer Scientists HACS Diversity s not just who you admit but also who has the support to stay and actually successfully complete their degree Audra Collins ABCS President computer science senior It was really two sides coming together Quistiano said We ve been trying to establish funding or scholarships of sorts since forever but for one reason or another it just never worked out While Collins and Quistiano were working on their plans UT s Department of Computer Science was actually at work behind the scenes establishing similar initiatives These initiatives were in line with those proposed by longtime department staff members Amy Bush and Kay Nettle who wanted to help start a scholarship to aid more of those students who had the ability but not the means to study computer science at UT With the department matching Bush and Nettle s funds the mutual goals of the students staff and department came together to create the Texas Computer Science Endowment for Change We have been part of the computer science department as students and employees for over 50 years combined and we ve seen it change in many ways Helping promote diversity in a department that has meant so much to both of us is a pretty amazing legacy said Bush and Nettle Beginning this year the endowment will support diversity and inclusion efforts and fund opportunities for underserved students with a demonstrated passion for technology Being a first generation student myself growing up there wasn t really anyone for me or many of these students to ask about computer science Quistiano said I was laughably unaware of how the tech industry worked and the academics of it all For example for the longest time I thought there was only like one technology major to give you one technology job Quistiano said that she and Collins hoped to create a network of support and mutual understanding among these students While ABCS and HACS do just that the two leaders saw that it wasn t enough for those who were struggling financially They wanted to do more and saw this project as an opportunity to get the department to better acknowledge these students and understand their perspectives Diversity s not just who you admit but also who has the support to stay and actually successfully complete their degree Collins said Brent Winkelman chief of staff of the department wholeheartedly agrees citing the department s long standing focus on not just recruitment but also long term retention which many institutions may overlook There are occasions when we may successfully recruit a student but then the student gets in and discovers Gosh this environment is just not a home for me Winkelman explained As a department we re committed to doing the work to ensure that no student has that reaction We want this to be a place where everyone can feel comfortable and welcome ABCS and HACS members from their 2019 fall kickoff meeting Credit Am rica Quistiano Winkelman said that there are a number of initiatives in the works directed toward diversity and inclusion and that the department is looking to scale up programs such as First Bytes a camp designed to expose high school women to futures in computer science and Code Longhorn a similar program designed for underrepresented populations throughout Texas These initiatives are great because what starts here changes the world right But how can you change the world if the people creating and building new things are not actually representative of the world if not everyone is included in that discussion Quistiano asked As for the beginnings of the new endowment Collins said they conducted extensive research on their own time into budgeting editing writing and drafting proposals They reached out to computer science professor Alison Norman who is also chair of the department s Diversity and Inclusion Committee for mentorship and guidance Norman was not at all surprised when Collins and Quistiano contacted her Our students are amazing she said They re hardworking and caring and they really want to have a positive effect on the world and are always hungry for information about just how to do that Norman provided advice and proofread their early drafts We wanted to be as best prepared as we could be before any sort of archetypal proposal Collins said Alison helped our efforts immensely and we were very persistent she said laughing After the department learned of Collins and Quistiano s ideas both sides worked together I think that everybody s goals were aligned and then it was just a matter of how to best achieve those goals said Norman of the project Soon enough their persistence and the hard work of the staff and faculty paid off Many many presentations virtual meetings discussions and considerations later the endowment was officially established and it started in fall 2020 This is just the beginning Am rica Quistiano HACS President computer science senior Today the endowment is listed on HornRaiser for donations and its scholarships are available to current and incoming undergraduate computer science students who have participated in Code Longhorn or who are current or future members of HACS or ABCS The effort for diversity and inclusion has always been there student org wise Collins said but what I wanted to establish is that once I graduate and leave the computer science department the staff actual department and administration they re now the ones leading the charge Quistiano added This is just the beginning Hopefully the endowment will grow and provide support for generations of future students to come and that s the mark we want to leave And the university is proud to uphold that legacy UT houses a lot of world class students in terms of their talent and abilities and also in their desire to have a positive impact Winkelman said And I think that we have seen that repeatedly from students like Audra and Am rica who have asked the department to think more ambitiously about how we can create change Copy link Email Share Link Twitter Share Link Facebook Share Link LinkedIn Share Link Tags College of Natural Sciences Diversity Inclusion and

graduate students Further information is available on the GRACS wiki GRACS represents the interests of CS graduate students within the University of Texas at Austin CS department provides services and information to graduate students and works to foster a sense of community among graduate students in the department To contact GRACS send mail to gracs cs utexas edu or visit the GRACS Web page at https www cs utexas edu gracs If you have comments about or suggestions on how to improve the documentation please e mail gracs cs Caution This is unofficial advice from fellow grad students and not official department policy See the UTCS Graduate Program web site for the final word on policy topics Arrival On arrival you should visit the CS Graduate Office to meet Katie Dahm and to fill out various forms The CS Graduate Office is located in GDC 2 724 Incoming Ph D students need to send Prof Greg Plaxton and cc gradoffice cs their proposed course schedule via e mail prior to registration The advising bar will not be removed and you will not be able to register until Prof Plaxton notifies the CS Graduate Office of his approval Note that all Ph D students must register for CS 398T their first fall semester Incoming master s program students have no formal advising The advising bar restriction registration will automatically be cleared prior to registration dates Fellowship students and those students who have been awarded RA ships should receive e mail messages instructing them whom to contact New TAs should receive e mail messages informing them about orientation meetings they need to attend If you don t have the appropriate e mail message s ask Katie Dahm what you should do The University requires some new international TAs to pass an English certification examination New international TAs who need the exam will be sent information by email from the CS Graduate Office All TAs and RAs are required to show proof of eligibility to work in the United States Proof must be in the form of a picture ID such as a driver s license or passport and at least one of the following Social Security card passport or a certified copy of your birth certificate Registration Start with the course schedule and your degree requirements Course schedules for each semester can be found by visiting the UT registrar s Web site Degree requirements can be found on the UTCS Graduate Program Web pages You can also determine your registration time slot by visiting http registrar utexas edu students registration and clicking on Check your Registration Information Sheet Other useful registration information can be found on this page Important You must carry a full time course load or many complications may occur including loss of funding and visa violations Talk to the grad office before registering for less than full time If you are a self funding student and do not need a visa to be in the US this warning does not apply Full time graduate students are required to take 9 hours of courses during the spring and fall semesters Typical classes count as 3 hours because they meet for three hours each week Thus you must register for at least three classes during the spring and fall Registering for 12 or more credits requires the permission of the student s advisor and the graduate advisor All TA RA and fellowship appointments require full time status Research is highly emphasized within this program and as such incoming students are required to start doing research their very first semester To this end incoming Ph D students are required to register for CS 398T during their first Fall semester CS 398T provides a forum for faculty to present their interests and for students to learn more about ongoing research Additionally full time Ph D students are required to register for 3 research credits CS 395 every semester from their second semester onward until they reach candidacy This means that Ph D students will take two courses plus CS 398T their first semester Requirements are subject to change Check with Katie Dahm in the CS Grad Office if you have any questions Most administrative tasks can be accomplished via UT Direct This includes registering for classes viewing and paying your tuition and fees updating your address information and many others Access to these services is secure and requires an electronic identifier UT EID and password both of which you should have created when applying to UT You ll need to consult the course schedule for courses offered and the steps for registration Keep in mind that there are invariably additions and or changes to the courses offered the schedule on the Web is always up to date Resources about deciding what courses to take include Department Degree Requirements Master s program Coursework Option Master s program Thesis Option Ph D program UTCS Diversity Course list Course Schedule Course Instructor Survey Results Department s Teaching Plan for future semesters subject to change Additionally you should talk to other graduate students If you would like to talk to individual professors about their classes check in the Graduate Office for information on office hours and office locations Note that some of the course work can be demanding If you have any weak points in your background it can be a very good idea to start slowly To save money when buying textbooks you can buy them through GRACS The GRACS wiki also has a few hints on Buying Books Ph D Comprehensive and Qualifying Examinations UTCS does not have Ph D comprehensive examinations comps Instead the program requires certain background and diversity breadth and depth courses The qualifying exam is your Ph D dissertation proposal presentation See the doctoral degree program requirements for details Financial Assistance See Also Insurance Funding can come from a combination of three sources Research assistantships Teaching assistantships Fellowships scholarships both external and UTCS internal Most master s students are self funding or using student loans but there are a few with funding from the above sources Doctoral students have funding terms specified in their letters of admission from the department After you have started working for a particular faculty member that professor may pay you as a graduate research assistant GRA using money from a grant Every semester the department selects students to act as teaching assistants for the next semester Doctoral students without other funding are chosen first Both TA and GRA positions are forms of UT employment and so have the accompanying benefits health insurance automatic tax withholding and paycheck direct deposit To check your employment status check Job appointments in UT Direct The department keeps a list of fellowships and scholarships you should review Most fellowships because of their generous terms are competitive and often require an application and recommendations However since fellowships are not a form of UT employment they often have added complications Typically you need to pay monthly for the UT employee benefits or find your own health insurance Taxes are not automatically withheld so it s important to set aside money for that Always make sure you understand the terms of the fellowship before it starts Another subtle difference between employment and fellowships is that employment pays you for the previous month s work while a fellowship often pays for the upcoming month Thus at the end of a fellowship you may have a month without a paycheck Also watch your e mail for occasional announcements of funding opportunities Obtaining In State Tuition Students being supported by teaching and research assistantships are eligible for in state tuition but there is a bureaucratic dance that must be performed to get it Students must fill out a form to change their tuition to in state rates via the Web It can all be done via the Web listed here https utdirect utexas edu acct fb waivers index WBX Log in click on the Request Wavier link on the left hand side of the page and follow the instructions Katie Dahm and the graduate office will send out e mails reminding you to do this at the beginning of each semester Important Points to Remember Students must have an EID in order to access this site Students may begin this process as soon as registration for the semester begins even if their appointment has not been confirmed By a designated time if the student is found not to be eligible for instate rates their application will be revoked and they will be billed for the non resident portion of their tuition Students must do this every semester in which they expect to be appointed for a 20 hr per week assignment as a TA AI GRA Students who are employed outside of their department will need approval from their graduate adviser If you will be employed by another department you can see Katie Dahm for this approval Pay the new bill before the applicable deadline Important Restrictions The University has a few important rules regarding graduate student funding They are typically not a problem but you should be aware of them nonetheless You can find more detailed information at the Office of Graduate Studies Also note that some of the rules are slightly different for international students UTCS Computer Account Katie Dahm in the CS Graduate Office will give you information on creating your UTCS account when you first check in Note that there are university wide computing resources and UTCS department resources These are almost completely unrelated separate log in IDs administrators documentation etc so be aware of this partition E mail You have two important official e mail addresses The address you listed in your student records Your UTCS department e mail address E mail is an essential channel of communication in the department and the university You will miss out on important information if you don t create your accounts and read your e mail regularly In fact it is university policy that you must check e mail sent to the address in your student records ideally daily but at least twice a week University E mail The university will send its official notices to the e mail address listed in your student records Keep this up to date The university provides you a UTmail account free which you can keep forever UTmail is Gmail but with the university s

information to graduate students and works to foster a sense of community among graduate students in the department GRACS consists of a five member executive committee GRACS sponsors the weekly Tea Time and occasional events both social and academic throughout the semester To help make this very large department a little less impersonal GRACS established a buddy system Each new Ph D student is given the opportunity to be matched with a fellow graduate student buddy who has volunteered to answer his or her questions This allows new students to feel at home faster than they might otherwise Buddies are chosen from graduate student volunteers who have been at UT at least a year with consideration given to matching countries of origin and research interests whenever possible We would like to encourage your participation in GRACS GRACS is your organization Its effectiveness depends on your participation Please attend GRACS events assist with GradFest and the buddy program or run for

with the CS department it s worth mentioning that one of the best things about the University of Texas at Austin is Austin It is a wonderful place to live with a tremendous number of things going on Austin is perhaps best known for having great music and being home to UT and the state capital Austinites enjoy a town that is big enough to offer a wide variety of things to do but not so large as to

Parking is based on a system of parking permits corresponding to different categories of students and employees Parking on the streets parking lots and garages on campus is marked according to the permits that are required to park there Note that all permits are mutually exclusive you can t use a better permit in a lesser parking area unless the signs explicitly allow it In addition the parking rules change depending on the time of day For example in the evening some areas are open to anyone The following is a brief summary of the relevant types of permits For more complete information see the university parking information Web page https www utexas edu parking To purchase any of the following permits go to My Parking Profile at https utdirect utexas edu apps pts parking and log in C permit The C permit is the cheapest and most easily obtained permit annual cost is currently 115 However it also offers the least desirable and most competitive parking options The C permit lets you park at C lots located east of IH35 or the Longhorn Lots located east of IH35 near UFCU Disch Falk Field A permit The A permit is for staff and is limited to those with 20 hour employment appointments TA RA and certain fellowships An A permit is more expensive than a C permit annual cost is currently 138 However an A permit allows you to park somewhat closer to the computer science buildings in A lots located east of IH35 or the Longhorn Lots located east of IH35 near UFCU Disch Falk Field Competition for these parking spaces is very tough though On week days during the semester expect to get into campus by 7am if you want to get a spot on San Jacinto One may often find a spot East of LBJ later in the morning M permit Parking marked M is for motorcycles only Many of these spaces are very close in to the campus but also fill up very quickly Currently an M permit is free if you have bought any type of permit already and 69 otherwise F Garage Permit The F garage permit is garage parking for faculty and staff and is limited to those with 20 hour employment appointments TA RA and certain fellowships You can purchase a garage permit for 408 a year Although expensive this option provides covered reliable parking since the garages rarely fill up S Garage Permit The S garage permit is available to all students who do not live on campus You can purchase a garage permit for 602 a year Although more expensive that the F garage permit the S permit is often available in more desirable garages like SJG Like the F garage permit this option also provides covered reliable parking The parking rules are often significantly relaxed during breaks such as winter break spring break and in between semesters Always check the official parking Web page during these periods Finally beware football game days On such days most of the parking on campus is reserved and you will have significant trouble parking on campus If you own a permit you are allowed to park in the San Antonio Garage the West most garage for free on game days Food There are vending machines located in most buildings on campus with wares ranging from soda to sandwiches to chips and cookies In GDC they are in the northwest corner of the north basement GDC 1 308 and in POB the machines are located in a room near the 2 100 corridor entrance on the East side of the building There are a plethora of restaurants

kuhlmanngj Greg Kuhlmann a was introduced to computers and programming by his family at a young age During Kuhlmann s childhood his grandfather taught him how to program on his VIC 20 when he was just six years old and his father would take him to Amiga Users Group meetings The ability offered by programming to change bits of code and see a new outcome right before his eyes was what really drew Kuhlmann in Unbeknownst to him he would go on to earn a graduate degree in computer science and start his own cybersecurity startup p p During his undergraduate studies at UCLA Kuhlmann became particularly interested in artificial intelligence automated theorem and areas of math which he had never encountered before This solidified the decision to continue his studies at The University of Texas at Austin which was spurred on by the Department of Computer Science s national ranking and the fact that he completely fell in love with Austin s lush and green cityscape p p As a graduate student Kuhlmann worked with a href https www cs utexas edu people faculty researchers vladimir lifschitz Vladimir Lifschitz a in his first year and then with a href https www cs utexas edu people faculty researchers peter stone Peter Stone a for the remainder of his time at UT Kuhlmann worked as a lead scientist for 21st Century Technologies where he applied machine learning and intelligent agent techniques to unmanned systems and data mining problems While pursuing his PhD at UT Kuhlmann was also involved with the a href https www cs utexas edu AustinVilla sim 3dsimulation Austin Villa Robot Soccer Team a which he has fond memories of He recalls the long nights spent working on the robots and the solidarity between him and his teammates that arose from them At two o clock in the morning you finally get it to work and you just feel such a bond with your fellow teammates that you ve been working on this thing together Nothing brings people together more than this sort of common struggle p p The idea of helping individuals remained a driving point in Kuhlmann s life upon receiving his PhD He worked as a data scientist at Apple for 9 years where the importance of both personal and professional connections was solidified for him You re helping these millions of people you re saving this company millions of dollars you re bringing a better customer experience to hundreds of millions of people and those numbers just feel too abstract Kuhlmann said He says that the thing that brought him the most satisfaction was being able to help people not just the big companies and corporations I realized that the thing I contributed that day made their life a little bit easier Kuhlmann said p p Now Kuhlmann is the Co Founder and CEO of Sumatra his Austin based self funded startup that provides Anti Fraud and Trust amp Safety as a Service He was inspired to start his company after realizing that sophisticated anti fraud systems used at big companies like Uber Apple and Facebook aren t widely available to smaller companies that could benefit just as much from them He saw those big companies go to conferences and talk about their sophisticated anti fraud systems But none of these systems are actually available more widely You realize that most of what is going on out there in the world is not just those big players Kuhlmann said He decided to step in and help bridge that gap p p At his startup Kuhlmann is able to continue utilizing both the teamwork and technical skills he was able to hone during his time at TXCS His expertise in data science and operations help companies at the next tier avoid scammers bullying harassment and all the different kinds of things that can happen in an ecosystem that makes for a bad customer experience His vision is to work with his team to assist these smaller companies succeed at a level that is traditionally reserved for the big names in tech His passion for helping people and smaller companies at a closer level continues to thrive within his vision for a future in which anti fraud systems are more widely available and accessible p p Currently his team is working to build the tools that will aid smaller companies to avoid fraud with an emphasis on anti fraud education and instruction The team realized that these tools are only as effective as people knowing how to use them Now we re at this point moving forward and we re adding a new element to it which is the training part of it as well So to really democratize this idea of trust and safety data science we need both better tooling and better training And that s what we re trying to bring together now Kuhlmann said As for what the future holds Kuhlmann plans on doing what he is passionate about for as long as possible In true data scientist wording he wants to make sure he s doing whatever he s doing 1 better every day and then taking advantage of the compound interest of that Whether it is at a personal level or at a corporate level Kuhlmann wants to help the people and projects he cares about to succeed p div div div div class field field name field news categories field type taxonomy term reference field label above div

Scientists a ABCS which seeks to create paths to educational and professional success for Black and other underrepresented students in this major p p Amid the pandemic earlier this year she met with fellow senior and close friend Am rica Quistiano She is president of the a href http texashacs org rel nofollow Hispanic Association of Computer Scientists a HACS which has similar aims for Hispanic and Latinx students Together these two leaders drafted plans to bring about social change for students at the departmental level p p Black and Hispanic Latinx students have been historically underrepresented in STEM fields and today computer science is no different As the leaders of their respective organizations Collins and Quistiano saw firsthand how underserved and underrepresented students were personally affected Many of their members were the first in their families to pursue a technical degree or any degree at all and they were struggling in their high school to college transitions Meanwhile other members had to work multiple jobs on top of full time enrollment to support themselves financially Collins and Quistiano saw these challenges and wanted to help and support

reason or another it just never worked out p p While Collins and Quistiano were working on their plans a href https www cs utexas edu rel nofollow UT s Department of Computer Science a was actually at work behind the scenes establishing similar initiatives These initiatives were in line with those proposed by longtime department staff members Amy Bush and Kay Nettle who wanted to help start a scholarship to aid more of those students who had the ability but not the means to study computer science at UT With the department matching Bush and Nettle s funds the mutual goals of the students staff and department came together to create the Texas Computer Science Endowment for Change p p We have been part of the computer science department as students and employees for over 50 years combined and we ve seen it change in many ways Helping promote diversity in a department that has meant so much to both of us is a pretty amazing legacy said Bush and Nettle p p Beginning this year the endowment will support diversity and inclusion efforts and fund opportunities for underserved students with a demonstrated passion for technology p p Being a first generation student myself growing up there wasn t really anyone for me or many of these students to ask about computer science Quistiano said I was laughably unaware of how the tech industry worked and the academics of it all For example for the longest time I thought there was only like one technology major to give you one technology job Quistiano said that she and Collins hoped to create a network of support and mutual understanding among these students p p While ABCS and HACS do just that the two leaders saw that it wasn t enough for those who were struggling financially They wanted to do more and saw this project as an opportunity to get the department to better acknowledge these students and understand their perspectives p p Diversity s not just who you admit but also who has the support to stay and actually successfully complete their degree Collins said Brent Winkelman chief of staff of the department wholeheartedly agrees citing the department s long standing focus on not just recruitment but also long term retention which many institutions may overlook p p There are occasions when we may successfully recruit a student but then the student gets in and discovers Gosh this environment is just not a home for me Winkelman explained As a department we re committed to doing the work to ensure that no student has that reaction We want this to be a place where everyone can feel comfortable and welcome

programs such as a href https www cs utexas edu outreach camps first bytes rel nofollow First Bytes a a camp designed to expose high school women to futures in computer science and a href https www cs utexas edu outreach camps code longhorn rel nofollow Code Longhorn a a similar program designed for underrepresented populations throughout Texas p p These initiatives are great because what starts here changes the world right But how can you change the world if the people creating and building new things are not actually representative of the world if not everyone is included in that discussion Quistiano asked p p As for the beginnings of the new endowment Collins said they conducted extensive research on their own time into budgeting editing writing and drafting proposals They reached out to computer science professor Alison Norman who is also chair of the department s Diversity and Inclusion Committee for mentorship and guidance p p Norman was not at all surprised when Collins and Quistiano contacted her Our students are amazing she said They re hardworking and caring and they really want to have a positive effect on the world and are always hungry for information about just how to do that p p Norman provided advice and proofread their early drafts We wanted to be as best prepared as we could be before any sort of archetypal proposal Collins said Alison helped our efforts immensely and we were very persistent she said laughing p p After the department learned of Collins and Quistiano s ideas both sides worked together I think that everybody s goals were aligned and then it was just a matter of how to best achieve those goals said Norman of the project Soon enough their persistence and the hard work of the staff and faculty paid off Many many presentations virtual meetings discussions and considerations later the endowment was officially established and it started in fall 2020 p p Today the endowment is listed on a href https hornraiser utexas edu

computer science students who have participated in Code Longhorn or who are current or future members of HACS or ABCS p p The effort for diversity and inclusion has always been there student org wise Collins said but what I wanted to establish is that once I graduate and leave the computer science department the staff actual department and administration they re now the ones leading the charge p p Quistiano added This is just the beginning Hopefully the endowment will grow and provide support for generations of future students to come and that s the mark we want to leave p p And the university is proud to uphold that legacy UT houses a lot of world class students in terms of their talent and abilities and also in their desire to have a positive impact Winkelman said And I think that we have seen that repeatedly from students like Audra and Am rica who have asked the department to think more ambitiously about how we can create change p p p div class video filter iframe src www youtube com

Cuzco Peru a these UT Austin researchers set out to understand how the increase of tourism and social media intersects with heritage regulations to aid in the creation of travel patterns across Cuzco s heritage landscape Additionally they embarked to study and document how social media has affected tourists aesthetic preferences and expectations p p Tourism in Cuzco Peru the former capital of the Incan empire began in the early 1900s following an expedition by Hiram Bingham By the 1920s government officials realized the economic potential of tourism in Cuzco and began funding the restoration of regional archaeological sites for tourism Since then tourism in Cuzco has taken off Today annual visits in the region top 3 million with heritage tourism tourism that involves traveling to places of cultural significance being a major draw By the late 70s tourist initiatives were being created to promote and popularize tourism in Cuzco s prominent archaeological sites including the creation of the original Boleto Turistico BTC tourist package in 1978 and the promotion of the Inca trail to Machu Picchu Over time these initiatives included packaged day trip itineraries to some Cuzco s more remote archaeological sites p p In their research Nicole D Payntar Wei Lin Hsiao R Alan Covey and Kristen Grauman collected 57 804 images from community internet photos shared on social media sites captured across 12 archaeological sites in the Cuzco region Through the use of geo tagging technology they were able to detect patterns of tourist movement at these sites and analyze how they ve changed over time AI technology also enabled them to categorize tourist images based on common themes such as mountains stonework alpaca terracing etc p p From this dataset spanning 2004 2019 these UT Austin researchers were able to bring to light some insightful patterns of tourists in Cuzco Peru They uncovered which sites were the most popular sites in the area the least visited and which sites people spent the most time at The data and geo tagging technology also allowed them to be able to track tourist patterns and determine how tourists moved across these archaeological sites Additionally the researchers were able to determine which type of aesthetic tourists were capturing in their pictures at each site These results led them to conclude that policies in the region have definitely affected how tourists interact with the sites The introduction of the day passes influenced how tourists travel across the region and conservation initiatives and regulations at larger tourist sites led to an increase in photo homogeneity while smaller sites with less regulation had much more diverse pictures The data also showed that the most popular pictures of the Cuzco region shared similar aesthetic qualities with the historic photographs published by Hiram Bingham in the early 20th Century This shows that heritage aesthetics remain pretty similar over time due to the visual reproduction of what is meant to be seen based on perceived experiences and audience consumption p p A study like this would not be possible if it were not for the rise of social media technologies and innovations in AI specifically applied computer vision and machine learning algorithms Due to our increasing online presence researchers are gaining access to more information about patterns in our lives than ever before AI plays an equally important role as it allows researchers to categorize and identify patterns in this immense amount of data The project would have been impossible to

reins of the podcast to our science writing intern Cason Hunwick He explores what artificial intelligence might teach us about how hyenas in Africa evolved a surprising hunting tactic Along the way you ll learn about an area of computer science called computational evolution where machines evolve solutions in response to complex problems and a lot more quickly than we living things can do Cason spoke with computer scientists Padmini Rajagopalan and Risto Miikkulainen from The University of Texas at Austin p p Cason Hunwick Imagine you re in a grassy African savannah the sun s hanging low just about to set but then you hear a lion You look over and see a lion standing over a zebra carcass There s blood and torn striped flesh in its mouth It s clear that the hunt is over and this is dinner But wait a spotted hyena has just approached the lion hoping to do what you just thought was impossible and steal some of the lion s kill It lunges for the zebra carcass But the lion makes a precise powerful strike and sends the hyena screeching and running Of course for a solo hyena to try this is pretty foolhardy and in attempting to steal prey from the lion it could easily become it p p CH But in groups spotted hyenas have found a way to steal the kill and walk away without a scratch scot free full stomachs They group up and execute a coordinated attack on the lions in a cooperative behavior known as mobbing Back on the savannah let s listen in as a collaborator of two UT computer scientists Michigan State University professor of integrative biology Kay Holekamp looks on at the behavior She is joined by a member of her lab Erin who provides the play by play in this recording of a successful mobbing event in Kenya Erin counts the approaching hyenas p p Erin one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen Fourteen hyenas p p CH Two more join and it becomes a frenzy p p Erin There s a mob kind of circled the lions they ve all clustered up over there p p Cason And finally they all rush together p p Erin They ve driven off two of the lions Oh They got the carcass Nice guys p p CH Mobbing has been the subject of study for decades because it s something of a mystery Hyenas behave instinctually and yet they find strength in numbers Enough hyenas together can overpower the stronger predators But how does this behavior evolve University of Texas at Austin computer science researchers Padmini Rajagopalan and Risto Miikkulainen studied this question p p Padmini Rajagopalan We can t study evolution in action in the real world the only way we can really do it is in simulation p p CH That s Rajagopalan She says evolution is just too slow to observe Plus you can t look back in time Instead you have to simulate how hyenas behaviors may have developed over the generations To accomplish this task Rajagopalan started out with 100 randomly generated learning algorithms they re sort of like stands in for those early hyenas brains And out of this first generation of 100 blank slate artificial hyenas Rajagopalan randomly selects ten of them assigning the task to mob the lion Now at least four of them will need to rush the lion simultaneously and if they run in too early they die If they come in after the lion is mobbed they get less food p p PR This way I test many different teams of 10 hyenas Once I ve done that I look at the population of hyenas and see which were closest to what I wanted them to do p p CH Many other teams of computerized hyenas from each generation are tested and run through these trials The hyenas that survive get to reproduce p p PR So what I mean by that is I mix up their little codes and get new hyenas that hopefully have some of the best characteristics p p CH The ones with higher fitness levels have more offspring This mimics how the behavior evolved in real life Hyenas that behave in ways that are beneficial then survive to mate and pass on their traits while those that behave in ways that hurt their chances of survival and mating are less likely to pass on their traits Repeating this selection testing and reproduction for 1 000 generations happens a lot faster on a computer than in real hyena lifetimes p p PR In the initial generations we saw other behaviors emerging There was this risk taking behavior where the hyena just went straight to the lion attacked the lion all by itself and died And there were these risk averse hyenas which stayed far away from the lion waiting for it to be driven away So they avoided death but they also didn t get much reward Slowly over the next few generations we saw that mobbing emerged as a kind of combination of these behaviors Both the risk averse and the risk taking p p CH So in other words mobbing arose out of two kinds of impulses the hyenas developed I don t want to die and I want the reward But then Rajagopalan saw something unexpected Those two extreme behaviors on each end of the spectrum rushing in and dying or waiting around the periphery those did not go away p p PR Those behaviors I mentioned that emerged early like the simple behaviors of attacking the lion by themselves or waiting around far away and never really participating in the mobbing event these behaviors still tended to stick around even though I evolved the hyenas for a very prolonged period So the mobbing behavior itself did emerge within the first ten generations but I kept the evolution going for 1 000 generations and still these other behaviors did not go away p p CH Why did they stick around Computer scientist Risto Miikkulainen who was Rajagopalan s advisor for the work asked the same question And he offered an explanation p p Risto Miikkulainen But why would they stay around You would think that hey now they have a successful mobbing that just takes over the whole population everybody does the same thing But you don t see that in biology I mean in all kinds of societies you see a persistent minority and we saw it here as well And that was a surprise but after the fact we can explain it Let s say that now there s a new species or new group of lions that are much much stronger for some reason So now it s really good to have hyenas that are less bold and the species survives and they develop a better strategy p p CH And similarly if lions became weaker being that fearless go it alone hyena might start to pay off with big rewards p p CH Now Miikkulainen explains that while these simulations are useful they won t entirely replace field work in the real world p p RM Computational simulations can always give you suggestions or insights or proposals on what to look at But the actual verification still has to be done in the discipline itself p p CH So thankfully biologists and computational scientists aren t in opposition Scientists can use technology in some constructive back and forth Biologists find something interesting in the field maybe in cells or primate behavior and computer scientists study it in theoretical space returning to the biologists a suggestion for what to look for in the field in real life For example in mobbing the UT computer scientists may ask field researchers if they observe those two hyena behaviors that stuck around in the simulations maybe if they see a hyena lurking far away and joining only after the mobbing has ended or if they see that brave hyena rushing in alone and risking its life In this way both groups need each other And there are plenty of fields this new kind of artificial intelligence computational evolution it s called could help Any field that involves complex problem solving can benefit from systems that evolve solutions to problems But Miikkulainen again makes it clear that the technology isn t meant to replace humans p p RM We are talking about machine creativity and machines coming up with surprises and solutions that humans won t think about But it s still a tool for humans It s an extension of their thinking p p CH This is Cason Hunwick reporting for Point of Discovery p p MA Thank you Cason Point of Discovery is a production of The University of Texas at Austin

to continually make robots more autonomous accurate robust and efficient in real world unstructured environments In the video above the robot referred to as the UT Campus Jackal navigated entirely autonomously from The Gates Dell Complex GDC to the Anna Hiss Gymnasium AHG The route which was about 0 6 miles required the robot to reason about its precise state in the world in real time despite unexpected variations in the world including construction vehicular traffic and pedestrians stay on track and avoid going off course p p Biswas and his team have been working on topics related to long term outdoor navigation since 2015 when he worked as an assistant professor at The University of Massachusetts at Amherst The UT Campus Jackal is one of two platforms another being a larger robot called UT Campus Husky that the team uses to undertake research on perception and planning for long term autonomy This topic includes exploration of building perceptual models that can adapt to changing environments in real time allowing agents to identify perception failures independently and learning robot customization from human demonstrations p p A key to the robot s successful navigation was the localization method used At the basic level localization is how an autonomous agent knows where it is on the map in relation to other elements The AMRL used a href https www joydeepb com Publications ras episodic nonmarkov localization pdf rel nofollow episodic non Markov localization a EnML a method introduced by Biswas and Manuela M Veloso that reasons about the world as consisting of three classes of objects long term features corresponding to permanent mapped objects short term features corresponding to unmapped static objects and dynamic features corresponding to unmapped moving objects p p Imagine that the robot the AMRL deployed was sent out to navigate autonomously at three different times during UT Austin s academic calendar during freshman orientation during a Student Organization fair and during midterms In each scenario the robot is navigating the same distance and the same path It can expect that the building and statues that it passes to remain constant throughout each excursion Yet each time that it s deployed the robot experiences non static objects that can affect its journey lost freshmen tables packs of students making their way to class For robots that are deployed long term these potential changes need to be accounted for and the robot has to understand that the map it has of the terrain most likely won t remain static EnML is a localization method that helps autonomous agents account for the changes in their environment to help them navigate in a more natural way p p Biswas stated that the AMRL is excited to have the robot autonomously perform experiments during such deployments to improve its own perception algorithms in the wild noting that they are also interested in performing such tasks like mail and package

enough for a simulation model to just issue predictions A decision maker needs to know just how much those predictions can be trusted p p This is the objective of research in the critical area of predictive science which is about to take a major step forward at The University of Texas at Austin The Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences has been selected by the Department of Energy DOE to establish a Multidisciplinary Simulation Center with the mission to develop the next generation of exascale predictive simulation capabilities The center will support the research of dozens of scientists post docs and students and will foster close collaboration with researchers at Sandia National Laboratories Los Alamos National Laboratory and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory p p Bob Moser and George Biros from the Oden Institute and UT s Walker Department of Mechanical Engineering are leading the team of 18 faculty and senior researchers from six different departments which also includes a faculty member from Texas State University The new center is part of the Predictive Science Academic Alliance Program PSAAP and this is just the third time that PSAAP centers have been awarded by the DOE National Nuclear Security Administration NNSA since the program s inception in 2008 UT Austin was one of only four institutions nationwide to be selected to establish a Multidisciplinary Simulation Center p p This shows the power of collaborative research and how it allows us to take on grand challenge problems Moser said The challenging research agenda

have many applications from advanced manufacturing to destruction of hazardous waste Currently an ICP torch experimental facility developed at UT Austin is being used to test materials for use on future spacecraft p p Simulating the torch however is a means to a greater end It is a way to achieve the primary objective of the center advancing predictive science capabilities Moser said p p Oden Institute researchers will develop capabilities for predictive modeling and simulation of the plasma torch while researchers from the Cockrell School of Engineering will conduct physical experiments A key goal of the project is to combine the power of simulation and experiment to improve predictive capability p p The center s capacity to advance predictive science is enabled by the supercomputing power and expertise available at the Texas Advanced Computing Center TACC Using systems such as TACC s Frontera the world s most powerful academic supercomputer in tandem with the DOE s high performance computing systems the new predictive science center will also advance exascale computing the next generation of the most powerful high performance computing systems p p TACC s exceptionally powerful computing resources will enable us to design and test novel exascale algorithms Biros said We anticipate discoveries in computer science HPC and computational science that could have a profound impact on large scale simulations especially on advancing more reliable predictions of complex systems p p UT Austin s new PSAAP III center is being supported through a 16 5 million

perseverance the Texas Computer Science TXCS alumna who graduated from the university in 1998 earned her degree at a time where there were probably four Black people in the whole computer science department With over 20 years of experience in the technology industry Jones has witnessed massive shifts in how the world grapples with diversity new technologies and how businesses operate p p Graduating from The University of Texas at Austin for Jones was a game changer After graduating she started working at a startup in Austin called 360Commerce As a Black woman who was the first in her family to graduate from college entering the technology field in the early aughts meant diving head first into a world I didn t know p p In her early career Jones was always the only woman most of the time And all of the time the only Black woman on the tech team Her experience made her question why there weren t more Black women programmers and how to change this lack of diversity In 2004 when Oracle acquired 360Commerce Jones saw an opportunity to create the type of diverse work environment that she dreamed of Rather than join another company and show management the value of a diverse workforce Jones decided to make her own company with diversity built into its DNA p p Her company called Lillii RNB stands for Let s imagine life with ladies in IT and is an IT consultancy that works with Fortune 500 companies and government agencies From the beginning her goal was to have a team that looks like the world This purposeful diversity not only allowed more people into the tech industry but it played a strategic role When you have that many ideas with a diverse group of people it makes us very valuable to our clients said Jones p p To me if you want to diversify your teams you can And that was my mission and now we have a very diverse team so it definitely can be done And those developers are out there you have to have the desire to find them she said p p Jones found that the biggest struggle while starting her business was raising capital to get my business off the ground After failing to get enough capital Jones saved 250 000 of her own money to finance her business From there she was able to start her business and hire employees whom she had to train in the relatively obscure technology p p Now Lillii RNB is off the ground and doing well They re doing so well that they are working on a technology solution with the potential to help cities open up as many are under strict guidelines during COVID 19 She participated in the Ascend 2020 Cohort III and while working with three other small business owners proposed a method that would allow cities to safely open p p Her cohort designed a method of installing Internet of Things IoT devices throughout different buildings being cleaned As the cleaning is complete the devices update the dashboard to show where and when each building was sanitized They proposed the idea to the city of Atlanta and are now working on deploying the technology p p I was thinking about accountability she said Jones believed that cities that were equipped with data would make their reopening efforts both more secure and justifiable It s one thing to open a city during a pandemic it s another to actually track with metrics and dashboards the methods that prove that a city is doing it safely We can tell city officials This is how we re reopening this is how we re cleaning this is how we re making sure that buildings are getting clean and are safe p p Jones is excited to see where her career and company take her Her story is an example of the power being courageous following your passion and having the willingness to be the lone voice in the room championing for change In her words It starts with us p div div div
