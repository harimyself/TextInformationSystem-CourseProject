Integrated Five Year BS Computer Science MSIS Our 21st century information age offers tremendous new opportunities for individuals who can master both cutting edge technologies and human centered design However obtaining such dual mastery is difficult to achieve under traditional educational programs requiring students to pursue disjointed study in separate disciplines with lack of integration extending time to graduation and requiring students to build the bridges between the technical and social sciences for themselves To address this growing need the University of Texas at Austin s School of Information iSchool and the Department of Computer Science have teamed up to offer an innovative integrated five year program which provides a combined educational path toward obtaining the knowledge necessary to build the information tools of the future We invite highly motivated students with strong academic records to pursue this new integrated program of study with the unique opportunity to earn two university degrees in only five academic years both a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Master of Science in Information Studies This program is ideal for students who seek to combine knowledge of back end cutting edge technologies with the front end human centered design skills needed to create productive user experiences Graduates of the joint program will be uniquely qualified for advanced placement in both the expanding job market and competitive Ph D programs in information and computer science This cross disciplinary 5 year program offers students a wide range of diverse course offerings coupled with the flexibility to tailor their individual programs of study to focus on topics of greatest interest The program culminates in a final capstone project challenging students to tackle open problems in research or professional practice and often involving industry engagement Course topics include but are not limited to human computer interaction user experience and usability design information architecture leadership and management information policy social cultural studies work practice studies and organizational processes of governmental corporate and cultural heritage institutions Many other advanced topics are also offered on a rotating basis e g visualization crowdsourcing data mining etc Admission Only current undergraduate Computer Science students in good academic standing may apply to the BSCS MSIS Integrated Program The application process takes place in two stages An initial application for pre admission submitted in spring semester of the junior year A final application for formal admittance into the Graduate School submitted in fall semester of the senior year The pre admission application deadline is May 1st of students junior year and includes the following required materials the application form a statement of purpose an academic summary three letters of recommendation the applicant should directly contact potential writers and request they email their letters of recommendation by the deadline above Additional optional application materials include a r sum and a list of publications The School of Information Admissions Committee will review applications and make decisions for pre approval based on a holistic review of application materials Pre admitted students must begin enrollment in the program during the fall semester of their senior year and by December 1st apply for formal admittance into the Graduate School meeting all standard admissions requirements for acceptance into graduate study at UT Austin As part of this formal Graduate School application process students must submit official GRE scores and an updated official transcript The School of Information Admissions Committee will then review each student s application materials and make final decisions regarding admission into the graduate program In the unlikely event that a student is pre admitted but not granted formal admittance into the program the student s status will revert to being a senior undergraduate and the student may proceed to complete the original undergraduate bachelor s degree BSCS MSIS Initial Application form Requirements To fulfill the requirements of the Integrated Program students must complete 120 hours of Computer Science undergraduate courses and

Continuity and working from home You are hereHome Turing Scholars Benefits Small Community Core Computer Science Honors classes are typically about fifty students and electives usually range from thirty to sixty students in size This gives Turing Scholars a unique opportunity to get to know their professors closely helping many find research opportunities The small class sizes mean Turing Scholars are exposed to a small stimulating community The Turing Scholars Student Association organizes regular events within this community such as brunches with professors potlucks and excursions into the city Cost Enrollment in the Turing Scholars Honors Program is available at no additional expense to students In addition Turing Scholars are eligible for scholarships specifically targeted for honors students and our students fare very well in the larger pool of department and University affiliated scholarships A poll of 60 Turing Scholars shows that 60 received at least one scholarship in the last academic year with each recipient averaging two scholarships Space in the Honors Dorms The University s three honors dorms Andrews Blanton and Carothers let students meet and form ties with students from other honors programs Collectively these students represent some of the most talented students in the University Excellent Career Opportunities The University s location in Austin the international reputation of the UT s CS department and the excellence of the honors program attract recruiters from across the country Even students completing only their freshman year often participate in paid summer internships at top tech companies such as Google Microsoft Facebook Amazon and Dell A poll of last year s freshmen sophomore and junior Turing Scholars indicated that 75 of them had obtained summer internships in the tech industry This even holds true for the freshmen class where more than 75 were able to find summer internships after their first year in college Typical pay ranges anywhere from 20 60 per hour with average pay at around 35 Google Facebook and Microsoft were the most popular internship destinations with around 25 of all Turing Scholars working there for the summer Undergraduate Research and Honors Thesis One of the requirements to graduate from Turing Scholars is that students write an honors thesis on original research This thesis is designed to emulate a PhD thesis while staying adjusted to the undergraduate level Students usually spend at least a year conducting research with a professor prior to writing the thesis and then defend their thesis in front of a panel of at least three professors This is by far the most challenging part of the program but many students find the experience greatly rewarding for learning critical thinking and problem solving skills Because our students have research experience they are highly sought after by top graduate programs Students interested in graduate school are usually admitted straight to PhD programs after their undergraduate degree In recent years students have gone onto top PhD programs in places like Stanford MIT UIUC Berkeley CMU and Cornell Excellent Multidisciplinary Experience Our program positions students for success in many areas not just those directly related to class Here are just a few examples of incredible experiences our students had after completing their freshman or sophomore years Interned at NASA s Goddard Space Flight Center Interned at the University of Minnesota s Bioinformatics Center Interned at the University of Colorado to study computer security Conducted research at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico Conducted research in numerical analysis at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm Sweden Earned patents for work at IBM

degree An intensive accelerated set of classes in freshman year designed to let students complete three semesters of work in only two Small class sizes 60 people which offer room for students to engage in discussion with professors directly in class Special upper division CS elective courses for which honors students get priority Two undergraduate research courses that culminate in an undergraduate honors thesis To see a typical four year plan check out the Honors degree plan at the UTCS degree plan page Following is a list of courses Honors students are required to take Note that this list only includes required courses which are a fraction of the total Honors and department level courses offered CS 314H Data Structures Students are introduced to advanced data structures and trained in software engineering techniques such as test methodology and agile workflow Students complete a set of diverse and challenging programming projects such as building a basic search engine or building a basic genetic algorithm to play Tetris CS 311H Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science Students are taught how to think formally and write proofs Students are exposed to the the fundamentals of Computer Science theory such as graph theory combinatorics and mathematical induction CS 429H Computer Organization and Architecture Students learn about how a computer works from transistors and logic gates to the compiler level and how hardware and software work together This is an intensive project based class which includes projects like building a simulated processor creating a basic compiler or implementing virtual memory CS 439H Principles of Computer Systems Students learn how Operating Systems work from the ground up This is also a project based class and projects in the past have included building basic operating systems from scratch CS 331H Algorithms and Complexity Students learn fundamental algorithms and complexity theory This course is heavily proof based and focuses on theory Topics covered include dynamic programming maximum flow and NP completeness CS 178H Introduction to CS Research This course helps students make the transition from classroom learning to the type of faculty advised independent learning that is necessary to complete an honors thesis CS 379H Computer Science Honors Thesis This course gives students course credit for writing their honors thesis It gives students room for writing their thesis during the last few semesters of their studies Undergraduate Research Research is an important part of our honors program An expectation of the program is that Turing Scholars get involved in a research project with a member of our faculty The CS 178H class that students typically take in the second semester of their freshman year provides an introduction to the department s research faculty and their research interests Students interested in graduate school should note that graduate school applications are typically submitted in the fall semester of their last year accordingly doing an honors thesis greatly helps with graduate school admissions The program heavily encourages students to get involved in research as early as possible usually no later than the spring of their junior year To achieve that goal students typically register for CS 370 Undergraduate Reading and Research which allows students to perform independent study under the supervision of some faculty member However research takes many forms students also participate in research internships off campus or are paid for on campus research Finally in the fall of their senior year Turing Scholars typically register for CS 379H the Computer Sciences Honors Thesis course Turing Scholars Benefits Curriculum Success Admissions

Turing Scholars Honors visit through our CS Ambassador Program You will not only get a tour of UTCS but also meet current Turing Scholars and see what it is like to attend an honors class lecture In February of every year we host goto Turing an event where we invite admitted students to come visit and learn more about the program We host live Q A s with current Turing Scholars and faculty on the Turing curriculum community and career opportunities You can also get the feel of an honors course from a sample lecture with one of our honors course professors We highly encourage admitted students come before making a decision on whether to attend the program Summer Preparation During your first semester in the Turing Scholars Honors Program you will begin studying the two foundations of computing as a science Data Structures CS 314H This is an intensive course designed to challenge students with prior programming experience It involves implementing large software projects in pairs Past projects include writing an artificial intelligence for Tetris and building a webcrawler Discrete Maths CS 311H This course is meant to introduce students to formal mathematical thinking and is excellent preparation for future theory oriented courses Topics include number theory graph theory combinatorics etc We have accepted into the program a diverse group of students You all show exceptional academic promise But your backgrounds differ widely The purpose of this page is to give each of you the opportunity to spend some time over the summer before you come to UT filling in holes in your prior experience and enriching your understanding of the depth of computer science as an intellectual discipline The suggestions we offer here are divided into three areas Programming in Java An introduction to object oriented programming in Java We describe a basic set of skills we hope everyone will have at the beginning of CS 314H We suggest that you review that list and then follow the suggested study guide if your background seems weak Logic and formal reasoning An introduction to formal logic and proof techniques Although no specific formal background is required for CS 311H prior familiarity with the main concepts will be a help We suggest a couple of books you might want to look at but mostly we list websites that contain tools that will let you practice some of the fundamental skills You ll also find links to some logic games that you can use to hone your reasoning skills The Big Picture Key intellectual ideas in the history of computer science and other things that are fun to think about We list here books that influenced our thinking about computing We want to share them with you None of them is required but if you can find the time to read a few of them over the summer you ll come to the program with a deeper understanding of why you re doing what you re doing Turing Scholars Benefits Curriculum Success Admissions Incoming Students Contact Us

community thrives Each of us thus has an individual responsibility to strive not just for our own goals but for the goals of the larger community In this document a group of the faculty have laid out a set of ground rules designed to make our department the kind of community in which we all want to live If a professor in one of your classes has pointed you here you should view this document as part of the syllabus for that class As a Student What You Can Expect from Your Department The CS Curriculum The faculty as a whole have the responsibility to formulate a curriculum that will prepare you for a lifetime of work in the field of computing Yes some of what you learn will get you a job right away Some of what you learn may seem more esoteric and less essential But remember that the faculty have lived through a lot of changes in the field They ve all had to learn new ideas new programming languages new architectures and new applications many times and without the aid of classes or textbooks They ve got a lot of first hand understanding of the fundamental concepts that make it easiest to adapt as new things come along Trust a bit and take advantage of this expertise Try to like every class you take Each Class that You Take The most important thing that each of your teachers should give you is a guided tour through the subject matter of the class After all you can go to the bookstore buy books read them and write some code without ever signing up for a class But whenever you do sign up for a class you have the right to expect that the instructor has read a lot of books solved a lot of problems and then chosen from all of that material 14 weeks of the most important ideas presented in the clearest fashion You have the right to expect that every instructor will show up for class on time and be prepared to conduct the class Responsiveness from the Instructional Staff In most of your CS classes you will have an instructor one or more TAs and possibly a set of proctors This group of people working as a team has the responsibility to do everything they can to help you learn Your instructor TAs and proctors should treat you with respect and encourage you to seek help when you need it Grades Publication of the Grading Policy You have a right to be told within the first four days of the semester how grades in each class will be determined You will be told what the basis of the grade will be and how much weight will be assigned to each component of the grade In some classes you may be told even more for example what numeric scores will be assigned what letter grades But keep in mind that this isn t always possible Classes that use different exams each semester may have very different score distributions from one semester to the next so it isn t possible to know in advance what thresholds make sense Fairness You have a right to expect that grades will be assigned fairly Every student who turns in the same quality of work will receive the same grade Feedback You have a right to see your graded work and to understand what if anything was wrong with the work you submitted Punctuality You have a right to expect that exams and assignments will be graded in a timely fashion It s hard to be more specific on this since the amount of time required to do a good job of grading depends so heavily on the kind of work and the staffing level of the class One concrete thing you should expect is that you will have gotten some substantive feedback on your performance in each class before the Q drop deadline As a Student What the Department Can Expect from You Academic Honesty The University and the Department are committed to preserving the reputation of your degree It means a lot to you In order to guarantee that every degree means what it says it means we must enforce a strict policy that guarantees that the work that you turn in is your own and that the grades you receive measure your personal achievements in your classes Every piece of work that you turn in with your name on it must be yours and yours alone unless explicitly allowed by an instructor in a particular class Specifically unless otherwise authorized by an instructor Students may not discuss their work with anyone except the instructor and other members of the instructional staff TA Section Leader or Lab Proctor Students may not acquire from any source e g another student or an internet site a partial or complete solution to a problem or project that has been assigned You are responsible for complying with this policy in two ways You must not turn in work that is not yours except as expressly permitted by the instructor of each course You must take all reasonable precautions to prevent your work from being stolen It is important that you do nothing that would enable someone else to turn in work that is not theirs Do not share your work with anyone else Make sure that you adequately protect all your files Even after you have finished a class do not share your work or published answers with the students who come after you They need to do their work on their own IMPORTANT The penalty for academic dishonesty will be a course grade of F and a referral of the case to the Dean of Students Office Further penalties including suspension or expulsion from the University may be imposed by that office One final word This policy is not intended to discourage students from learning from each other nor is it unmindful of the fact that most significant work in computer science and in the computing industry is done by teams of people working together But because of our need to assign individual grades we are forced to impose an otherwise artificial requirement for individual work In some classes it is possible to allow and even encourage collaboration in ways that do not interfere with the instructor s ability to assign grades In these cases your instructor will make clear to you exactly what kinds of collaboration are allowed for that class Attendance at Classes and Exams Specific policies on class attendance will be set by individual instructors Make sure you follow those policies Whether you come to class or not you are responsible for keeping up with what happens in class If you miss a class other than for illness or an emergency it is not reasonable for you to expect your instructor or TA to repeat just for you the material that was covered in the class that you missed This applies both to the content of the class as well as to announcements about class policies events deadlines or whatever Final examination schedules are published at the time of preregistration If you are making end of semester travel plans make sure that you will still be here to take each of your finals at the scheduled time Travel plans are not a valid reason for missing an exam or asking for a special exam time The policy on makeup exams will be set by individual instructors Sometimes a makeup will be allowed but many times it will not be Except for emergencies you must take each exam at its scheduled time unless you have made prior arrangements with the instructor Keep in mind that is often difficult or impossible for an instructor to create a separate makeup exam that is guaranteed to be of equal difficulty as the regular exam Demands of a job or job interviewing are never valid reasons for missing a class or a deadline or an exam Classroom Behavior You have the right to learn in every class you attend But you have the responsibility to help assure that every other student shares that right Specifically Come to class on time Do not leave early These things are very disruptive Recognize that the buses and the parking space situation are unpredictable elements and allow for that If you must come late or leave early for example because of a doctor s appointment let the instructor know in advance Don t be disruptive during class Don t chat with your neighbor or rustle the newspaper Don t allow your electronic devices to be disruptive Turn off your cell phone beeper and watch alarm Participate Academic Work outside the Classroom The only way to learn computer science is to do it You should plan to spend a substantial amount of time outside the classroom working on each class that you take For some classes that will mean programming For others it may mean reading studying working problems writing or whatever Don t let this work slide It will not generally be possible either to do a programming project or learn the material in a theoretical class the night before the due date or the exam You should be working on your own every week of the semester A deadline is a deadline Each instructor will publish the class policy for turning in late work Plan your work accordingly Don t push the deadlines and don t expect the instructor to do anything other than what has been published Even five minutes is late Your instructor can t just acquiesce and accept your project five minutes late Then what about seven or ten or fifteen or thirty What about the other students in the class who had to miss some other event in order to get their work in on time Is it fair to them to accept your work late No Plan that the printer will be down and the busses will be late on the day your assignment is due Don t cut it down to the wire And if you do accept the published consequences with grace Faculty and Staff Interaction Your instructor plus any TAs and or proctors assigned to your class will work as a team to help you learn But you need to interact with them in a reasonable way Specifically Remember that the instructional staff are a team They will not all do everything The instructor will tell you who will be responsible for what Respect that If you ask the wrong person your question you probably won t get a reasonable answer and you will waste their time as well as yours For many kinds of questions it really is better to ask the TAs or the proctors This is particularly true of nitty gritty questions that arise in the labs since the TAs and proctors are likely to spend more time there than the instructor does It s their job The University s electronic mail policy recognizes email as an effective way for your instructor and TAs to inform you about important things that may be happening in class You are responsible for Making sure that your instructor has a valid email address for you If you do not want to use the one that the university has on record then make sure to give your instructor another one Reading your email every day Guaranteeing that your mailbox does not overflow Excuses such as My email box was full I don t use that email address any more I was too busy to check my email I was on an interview trip and couldn t check my email or My computer crashed and all of my email was destroyed aren t acceptable Email is also a very valuable way for you to communicate with your instructor and TAs But be sure you use it appropriately Specifically Using email it s easy to ask a question or make a comment that you d never make in person Be careful about this If you think that what you re about to say wouldn t be something you d feel comfortable going to office hours to say you probably shouldn t say it in email either In particular do not send email to your instructor or anyone else for that matter when you re angry You ll regret it when you calm down and you ll have antagonized someone who is important to you Remember that the instructor has a permanent record of every email message Feel free to use email to ask questions about projects and homework assignments But keep in mind that although email is available neither the instructors or the TAs are responsible for replying to email the instant it is sent Don t wait until the last minute before something is due to ask your questions Also keep in mind that if you ask a question that has a nontrivial answer it may not make sense for the instructor or TA to write a small book for you Sometimes it will be reasonable for them to ask you either to bring the question to class or to come to office hours to discuss it Although it s easy for you to dash off an email question it takes time for the instructor or the TA to answer it Don t ask questions to which you can find the answer somewhere else For example don t write to your instructor to ask where the regularly scheduled final exam is It s on the Registrar s web site Don t write and ask how much the first midterm counts It should be on the class syllabus Don t ask what happened in a class that you missed unless you had an emergency Office hours are there for you to use You can expect that the person who is teaching your class loves the material and wants to share it with anyone who will listen If you have questions about what s been covered in class or you re interested in finding out more about something go to office hours and ask You ll probably find that it s hard to get the faculty to shut up The one thing that most faculty hate is students who only come to office hours to ask questions about grades If there s been a mistake in grading your work of course go and ask see below But think twice before you go to office hours to ask questions that give the impression that you care less about learning than you do about grades A few other points to keep in mind about office hours If you can t make it to regularly scheduled office hours ask for an appointment But don t leave this to the day before the exam It may not be possible to find a suitable time on such short notice Again remember the team concept The faculty and TAs for your class will try to schedule their office hours to cover as wide a range of times as possible If you can t make it to one person s office hours try someone else s Unless an office door is already open knock first and don t go in until you re invited to do so Grades Grades are a necessary evil You don t like worrying about grades and the faculty hate having to assign them We d all rather focus on the content of our classes But your degree is a commitment from the University that you have achieved a certain level of expertise in the classes you ve taken so we need some way to measure that To make this process work you need to understand The grade you are given either on an individual exam or assignment or as your final grade is not the starting point of a negotiation It is your grade unless a concrete error has been made Do not go to see your instructor or your TA to ask for a better grade because you want one or you feel you deserve it Go only if you can document a specific error in grading or in recording your scores Your grade is a reflection of only one thing how well did you do in the class Nonacademic circumstances have no bearing on your grade Don t go to see your instructor and explain how important a better grade is in your life It would be unfair to other students and it would undermine the meaning of the degree if the instructor responded to such issues If you believe that an error has been made in grading your work you have one week from the time that the work was returned to the class to file a complaint in writing to your instructor Note that this is one week from the time that the instructor made the work available to the class If you missed class and didn t get your work until later there is no extension of the one week deadline If you decide to submit a complaint about the grading of your work make sure to describe the issue clearly and return the original work and your note to your instructor Errors can certainly be made in grading But keep in mind that the errors can be made either in your favor or not So it s possible that if you ask to have a piece of work regraded your grade will go down rather than up Remember that the most important characteristic of any grading scheme is that it be scrupulously fair to everyone in the class Keep this in mind if you re thinking of asking for example for more partial credit points on a problem The important thing is not the exact number of points that were taken off for each kind of mistake The important thing is that that number was the same for everyone So it can t be changed once the grading is done and the papers have been returned You instructor will decide what it takes to get an A or a B or a C or D in the class Deciding the boundary cases is always hard Your instructor is under no obligation to make score cutoffs public or to tell you how far away your were from the next higher grade 2317 Speedway

average cost of tuition for an in state student at a public university in the United States has increased by 296 over the past 20 years At the same time wages in the U S have barely grown in that same time College students are graduating with more debt than ever Statistics indicate that minority students often graduate with more debt than their peers Fortunately federal grants and scholarships for minorities can significantly lighten the financial load for these students The U S Department of Education recently invested 96 million in grants to provide additional financial aid specifically for minority students This grant funding will go directly to colleges and universities to help them provide better financial support to their minority populations Minority students who receive federal grants and loans to help finance their college educations often could use some additional funding to help them bridge financial gaps Scholarships for minorities are of tremendous help to these

are typically awarded to students based on academic merit leadership in the community extra curricular involvement or financial need Scholarships are often awarded on a yearly basis and many can be renewed for up to four years if a student maintains a certain GPA Scholarships can be used to cover expenses for tuition room and board and books Unlike loans they do not need to be repaid after graduation Grants Grants help college students pay for academic expenses and often come from the federal government Pell Grants Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants Academic Competitiveness Grants and SMART Grants are some of the most common types of federal grants students receive Students are given these grants based on need academic merit and other factors The federal government does not typically consider cultural heritage or ethnicity when selecting grant recipients but many minority students benefit from federal grants Some corporations private organizations and post secondary institutions do offer grants to minority students specifically Minority grants for college are awarded based on cultural heritage and need Non minority grants that target specific populations such as students with disabilities are also available Grants do not need to be repaid Work Study The Federal Work Study Program works with approximately 3 400 post secondary institutions to provide part time work for students to help them pay for educational expenses Work study opportunities are awarded to students based on financial need and participating students work directly for their colleges or universities often in community service capacities or in roles related to their majors Students receive no less than federal minimum wage for their work The mission of the Federal Work Study Program is to guarantee that the college students demonstrating the most financial need are able to find part time jobs while they are in school Federal Student Loans The federal government offers Stafford Loans Perkins Loans and PLUS loans to help students fund undergraduate expenses Stafford and Perkins Loans are awarded to students based on financial need and boast relatively low interest rates and flexible repayment options PLUS loans are given to the parents of college students to help them pay for the college tuitions and expenses of their sons and daughters Federal student loans can either be subsidized or unsubsidized If a loan is subsidized the federal government pays for the interest it accrues while a student is in school If a loan is unsubsidized it accrues interest while a student is in school which the student must pay after graduating Students typically do not have to start paying off either type of loan until six months after college graduation Private Loans If scholarships grants and federal loans do not cover all of a student s educational costs private loans are an option Private loans are issued by private financial institutions and they require credit history checks Because many college students do not have much credit history private loans often require co signers The interest rates on private loans tend to be higher than the interest rates on federal loans Additionally most private loans are unsubsidized which means they accrue interest while students are in school Private loans are also not eligible for federal loan consolidation and repayment programs They must be paid off separately from federal loans on timelines decided by the involved private lenders Filing the FAFSA Filing a Free Application for Federal Student Aid FAFSA is a critical step for college students who wish to determine whether they are eligible for financial aid in the form of federal grants federal loans and work study opportunities Once a FAFSA is processed a student s college or university receives a specific amount of funding to distribute to the student in the form of federal grants or loans Some scholarship programs also require that students file a FAFSA before applying Students complete the FAFSA by filling out a paper copy and sending it to the U S Department of Education or by filling out an online FAFSA form Both paper and online versions of the FAFSA are offered in English and Spanish A student must have a social security number to file a FAFSA Undocumented students with DACA approval may be able to obtain a social security number and apply for federal financial aid The annual deadline to submit a FAFSA is June 30 Financial assistance is often awarded on a first come first serve basis Students who submit their FAFSAs early may receive more robust funding packages and students who miss the deadline may be ineligible for financial aid from the federal government Scholarship Application Tips Make an impression with admissions offices as you apply to colleges Colleges and universities award a large number of scholarships to their students Oftentimes you are automatically considered for these scholarships when you send in your application Individual institutions also often award scholarships and grants specifically to minority students Scholarships are not guaranteed with acceptance to a college or university though They are often awarded to students who wow admissions committees with impressive applications stellar essays and extensive community involvement Estimate how much money you will need in terms of loans and scholarships If you demonstrate a significant amount of financial need there is a good chance that you will receive a significant amount of funding from your college and or the federal government This may not cover all of your costs however Use financial aid calculators to figure out how much money you ll need from third party scholarships and loans to cover the rest of your expenses This will help you figure out which scholarships to apply to and how aggressively you should try to win scholarships Create a spreadsheet of scholarships with deadlines As you research scholarship opportunities keep a list of the ones you want to apply to in a spreadsheet This will help you keep track of deadlines and any other applicable information you will need later when you start applying Staying organized will help you ensure that you don t forget to apply to any scholarships or miss any deadlines Ask for letters of recommendation early The majority of scholarship applications ask for letters of recommendation When you ask teachers and mentors to write letters of recommendation for your college applications you may also want to ask if they would feel comfortable giving you copies You may be able to use these in scholarship applications which means they won t have to take the time to upload or send additional letters when you apply Make sure you let your personality shine in scholarship essays If you re applying to minority scholarships or any type of scholarships you want to stand out Being a good student isn t always enough to win you a scholarship Write about any challenges you ve faced and write about what it has been like to be a minority student in high school If you can insert some humor into your essays go for it The more memorable and unique your essay the better Treat applying to scholarships as a numbers game There will be several other qualified students applying to the scholarships on your radar Keep this in mind and try not to take it personally if you don t get chosen for certain scholarships Keep applying The more scholarships you apply to the more likely you are to be chosen as a recipient Watch out for scams Unfortunately some people make up fake scholarships to get personal information from students and exploit them Make sure you do enough research to guarantee that a scholarship is credible before you apply Do not give any personal information to a scholarship fund that doesn t seem legitimate Additionally if a scholarship s website seems as though it hasn t been updated in a couple of years you might want to consider passing on it Tailor your application to your audience Take a good look at each scholarship foundation s mission and try to envision what type of applicant they are most likely to select In your application highlight aspects of your background and experience that you think are aligned with their mission If they mention that they value community service for instance make sure you mention your volunteer work in your application You should not expect to turn in the same essay to every scholarship foundation Figure out what each one is looking for specifically Show don t tell You may have heard your English teacher say show don t tell regarding good writing This essentially means that you provide concrete examples instead of making broad statements You should try your best to do this in your scholarship applications For instance rather than writing that you are a hard worker in your essays consider outlining your specific academic achievements extra curricular activities and part time jobs This will show that you re a hard worker Triple check your applications Careless mistakes and omissions can sometimes cost you a scholarship when the competition is fierce Make sure you thoroughly review each application before you submit it to ensure that you aren t forgetting any important points or neglecting to fill in any mandatory fields It can also be beneficial to have a friend or family member look over your applications before you submit them They might notice small errors you missed Additional Scholarship Resources FAFSA This is the website where students can fill out a FAFSA form to figure out which types of financial aid they can receive It should be the one of the first resources students use in their quest to finance their college educations Students should keep in mind that filing a FAFSA requires a social security number and information about their families incomes U S Department of Education Funding Information This site provides students with additional information about federal loans and grants It offers resources about loan repayment options consolidation and payment plans It is also a source of helpful links to information about specific lenders students may be borrowing from and how to get in touch with those lenders U S News and World Report s Paying for College This section of the U S News and World Report website is full of relevant information about loans scholarships budgeting while in college saving for college expenses paying for an online education and more College students who feel like they should brush up on financial literacy topics will find that this resource brings a lot to the table Fastweb A search tool for scholarship opportunities for college students Fastweb is a great starting point in a student s search for financial assistance Fastweb also provides resources and links to help students figure out how to pay for college Additionally the site offers career advice and a college search tool Unigo Unigo is an online database of college scholarship internship and student loan options It also provides information about possible college majors and career paths for

they should try to save for college and how much they should seek in funding in terms of loans grants and scholarships They also help students calculate things like interest on unsubsidized loans and

in Campus Scale Autonomous Navigation Submitted by Valeria Sixtos on Tue 10 06 2020 9 45am The UT Campus Jackal left and the UT Campus Husky right A group of Texas Computer Science TXCS researchers from the Autonomous Mobile Robotics Laboratory AMRL comprising Joydeep Biswas Sadegh Rabiee Jarrett Holtz Kavan Sikand Max Svetlik and John Bachman UMass Amherst have reached an incredible milestone in their research deploying an autonomous robot that autonomously navigates on the campus scale resilient to everyday changes and varying conditions Professor Biswas leads the AMRL a UT Austin research group that performs research in robotics to continually make robots more autonomous accurate robust and efficient in real world unstructured environments In the video above the robot referred to as the UT Campus Jackal navigated entirely autonomously from The Gates Dell Complex GDC to the Anna Hiss Gymnasium AHG The route which was about 0 6 miles required the robot to reason about its precise state in the world in real time despite unexpected variations in the world including construction vehicular traffic and pedestrians stay on track and avoid going off course Biswas and his team have been working on topics related to long term outdoor navigation since 2015 when he worked as an assistant professor at The University of Massachusetts at Amherst The UT Campus Jackal is one of two platforms another being a larger robot called UT Campus Husky that the team uses to undertake research on perception and planning for long term autonomy This topic includes exploration of building perceptual models that can adapt to changing environments in real time allowing agents to identify perception failures independently and learning robot customization from human demonstrations A key to the robot s successful navigation was the localization method used At the basic level localization is how an autonomous agent knows where it is on the map in relation to other elements The AMRL used episodic non Markov localization EnML a method introduced by Biswas and Manuela M Veloso that reasons about the world as consisting of three classes of objects long term features corresponding to permanent mapped objects short term features corresponding to unmapped static objects and dynamic features corresponding to unmapped moving objects Imagine that the robot the AMRL deployed was sent out to navigate autonomously at three different times during UT Austin s academic calendar during freshman orientation during a Student Organization fair and during midterms In each scenario the robot is navigating the same distance and the same path It can expect that the building and statues that it passes to remain constant throughout each excursion Yet each time that it s deployed the robot experiences non static objects that can affect its journey lost freshmen tables packs of students making their way to class For robots that are deployed long term these potential changes need to be accounted for and the robot has to understand that the map it has of the terrain most likely won t remain static EnML is a localization method that helps autonomous agents account for the changes in their environment to help them navigate in a more natural way Biswas stated that the AMRL is excited to have the robot autonomously perform experiments during such deployments to improve its own perception algorithms in the wild noting that they are also interested in performing such tasks like mail and package delivery This project is being funded by UT s Good Systems which is a grand challenge working at the intersection of artificial intelligence and human values Read more about these robots and Good Systems journey here News categories Graduate StudentsResearchTags Artificial

Boost Thanks to the Department of Energy Submitted by Anonymous on Mon 10 05 2020 9 00am Predictive science is crucial to the prediction and modeling of extreme weather This is a visualization of predicted storm surge on the Louisiana coast caused by Hurricane Laura the Category 4 Atlantic hurricane that struck Texan shores earlier this year Credit Computational Hydraulics Group Oden Institute Source College of Natural Sciences Many of the decisions we make are now guided by computational simulations from designing new spacecraft to predicting the spread of a pandemic But it s not enough for a simulation model to just issue predictions A decision maker needs to know just how much those predictions can be trusted This is the objective of research in the critical area of predictive science which is about to take a major step forward at The University of Texas at Austin The Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences has been selected by the Department of Energy DOE to establish a Multidisciplinary Simulation Center with the mission to develop the next generation of exascale predictive simulation capabilities The center will support the research of dozens of scientists post docs and students and will foster close collaboration with researchers at Sandia National Laboratories Los Alamos National Laboratory and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Bob Moser and George Biros from the Oden Institute and UT s Walker Department of Mechanical Engineering are leading the team of 18 faculty and senior researchers from six different departments which also includes a faculty member from Texas State University The new center is part of the Predictive Science Academic Alliance Program PSAAP and this is just the third time that PSAAP centers have been awarded by the DOE National Nuclear Security Administration NNSA since the program s inception in 2008 UT Austin was one of only four institutions nationwide to be selected to establish a Multidisciplinary Simulation Center This shows the power of collaborative research and how it allows us to take on grand challenge problems Moser said The challenging research agenda called for by the DOE can only be achieved by drawing on strengths across campus in computational science computer science physics modeling uncertainty quantification and physical experiments The team includes three members of the College of Natural Sciences Keshav Pingali a professor of computer science Chris Rossbach an assistant professor of computer science and David Hatch a research scientist at the Institute for Fusion Studies The group will focus on developing predictive simulations of an inductively coupled plasma ICP torch in unprecedented detail These torches have many applications from advanced manufacturing to destruction of hazardous waste Currently an ICP torch experimental facility developed at UT Austin is being used to test materials for use on future spacecraft Simulating the torch however is a means to a greater end It is a way to achieve the primary objective of the center advancing predictive science capabilities Moser said Oden Institute researchers will develop capabilities for predictive modeling and simulation of the plasma torch while researchers from the Cockrell School of Engineering will conduct physical experiments A key goal of the project is to combine the power of simulation and experiment to improve predictive capability The center s capacity to advance predictive science is enabled by the supercomputing power and expertise available at the Texas Advanced Computing Center TACC Using systems such as TACC s Frontera the world s most powerful academic supercomputer in tandem with the DOE s high performance computing systems the new predictive science center will also advance exascale computing the next generation of the most powerful high performance computing systems TACC s exceptionally powerful computing resources will enable us to design and test novel exascale algorithms Biros said We anticipate discoveries in computer science HPC and computational science that could have a profound impact on large scale simulations especially on advancing more reliable predictions of complex systems UT Austin s new PSAAP III center is being supported through a 16 5 million DOE cooperative agreement over five years News

Company Prioritizing a Diverse Work Environment Submitted by Muhammad Muhdhar on Mon 09 14 2020 8 00am Barbara Jones is no stranger to perseverance the Texas Computer Science TXCS alumna who graduated from the university in 1998 earned her degree at a time where there were probably four Black people in the whole computer science department With over 20 years of experience in the technology industry Jones has witnessed massive shifts in how the world grapples with diversity new technologies and how businesses operate Graduating from The University of Texas at Austin for Jones was a game changer After graduating she started working at a startup in Austin called 360Commerce As a Black woman who was the first in her family to graduate from college entering the technology field in the early aughts meant diving head first into a world I didn t know In her early career Jones was always the only woman most of the time And all of the time the only Black woman on the tech team Her experience made her question why there weren t more Black women programmers and how to change this lack of diversity In 2004 when Oracle acquired 360Commerce Jones saw an opportunity to create the type of diverse work environment that she dreamed of Rather than join another company and show management the value of a diverse workforce Jones decided to make her own company with diversity built into its DNA Her company called Lillii RNB stands for Let s imagine life with ladies in IT and is an IT consultancy that works with Fortune 500 companies and government agencies From the beginning her goal was to have a team that looks like the world This purposeful diversity not only allowed more people into the tech industry but it played a strategic role When you have that many ideas with a diverse group of people it makes us very valuable to our clients said Jones To me if you want to diversify your teams you can And that was my mission and now we have a very diverse team so it definitely can be done And those developers are out there you have to have the desire to find them she said Jones found that the biggest struggle while starting her business was raising capital to get my business off the ground After failing to get enough capital Jones saved 250 000 of her own money to finance her business From there she was able to start her business and hire employees whom she had to train in the relatively obscure technology Now Lillii RNB is off the ground and doing well They re doing so well that they are working on a technology solution with the potential to help cities open up as many are under strict guidelines during COVID 19 She participated in the Ascend 2020 Cohort III and while working with three other small business owners proposed a method that would allow cities to safely open Her cohort designed a method of installing Internet of Things IoT devices throughout different buildings being cleaned As the cleaning is complete the devices update the dashboard to show where and when each building was sanitized They proposed the idea to the city of Atlanta and are now working on deploying the technology I was thinking about accountability she said Jones believed that cities that were equipped with data would make their reopening efforts both more secure and justifiable It s one thing to open a city during a pandemic it s another to actually track with metrics and dashboards the methods that prove that a city is doing it safely We can tell city officials This is how we re reopening this is how we re cleaning this is how we re making sure that buildings are getting clean and are safe Jones is excited to see where her career and company take her Her story is an example of the power being courageous following your passion and having the willingness to be the lone voice in the room championing for change In her words It starts with us News categories AlumniTags Alumnidiversity and inclusionCOVID 19 Add new comment Your name E mail The content of this

00am A team comprising Texas Computer Science TXCS Ph D student Santhosh Ramakrishnan postdoctoral researcher Ziad Al Halah and TXCS Professor Kristen Grauman recently won first place in the 2020 Habitat visual navigation challenge held at the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition CVPR The event consisted of two challenges ObjectNav which required an agent to find a specific object in an unknown environment such as locating a fireplace in a room and PointNav which required an agent to navigate to a target coordinate in an unknown environment ObjectNav focused on recognizing objects and commonsense reasoning about object semantics like knowing that a fireplace is typically located in the living room PointNav in comparison focused on simulation realism and sim2real predictivity the ability to predict a model s navigational performance when used by a real robot by examining its performance in a simulation The TXCS team won the PointNav side of the challenge Several teams competed against each other as they tried to design a learning agent that can enter an unfamiliar environment and quickly learn how to navigate the space while performing an intelligent search to find a given location or object Ramakrishnan a third year Ph D student further explained the challenge the agent doesn t have a map of the environment it knows nothing about it It s given a coordinate that it needs to get to very quickly and success is measured by whether or not it reaches the point and how quickly it reaches the point This challenge was serendipitous for Ramakrishnan who has been working with Professor Grauman for three years and whose research is primarily focused on the intersection of computer vision and reinforcement learning He worked on Occupancy Anticipation for Efficient Exploration and Navigation with the UT Austin Computer Vision Group before entering the challenge As opposed to the typical approach in visual navigation which focuses on building a map by documenting what the agent can see the paper explores a different method predicting the things that aren t immediately seen Ramakrishnan explained the research in terms of a bedroom When entering a bedroom agents could easily perceive objects such as a floor or a bed But what about objects under the bed or behind it If I m entering a bedroom and I don t see everything behind the bed I can still guess that there s going to be some amount of floor space behind the bed because I would have to get on it This research helps autonomous agents navigate their environment more efficiently by predicting the unseen The work was ideal for tackling the PointNav challenge We thought that we might try out the idea in this particular challenge because it fits well he said It was interesting to bridge the gap between work at the research level versus work that needs to function well at the level of competition You re competing with people who are working on the same problem at the same time In such an event everyone is at their best The most rewarding part of entering the challenge was pushing the boundaries of what a method can do and get the best performance that they could Ramakrishnan said News categories FacultyGraduate StudentsResearchTags Santhosh RamakrishnanZiad Al HalahKristen GraumanObjectNavPointNavComputer Vision Add new comment Your name E

Community As They Return to Campus Submitted by Angela Schiff on Mon 08 24 2020 4 07pm As students faculty and staff prepare to return to campus for the fall semester a key concern is making the university as safe as possible and properly tracking health data to prevent outbreaks An interdisciplinary team of researchers and students including Texas Computer Science TXCS undergraduate students Rohit Neppali Anshul Modh Viren Velacheri and Ph D student Anibal Heinsfeld developed the Protect Texas Together app to help track and mitigate the spread of COVID 19 on the Forty Acres When asked about his motivation for joining the project Heinsfled said that what appealed to him was the possibility of providing a useful resource for our UT community in these difficult times together with the challenge of developing a scalable and helpful platform ready for this fall He added what kept my enthusiasm was the constant mindset of data privacy every feature needed to be scrutinized and tested to guarantee that the user data was reasonably private Modh echoed this sentiment stating that the developers wanted to design an app that would be beneficial without infrinign on user s privacy One of the long term goals of this initiative is to enable research in the future from the anonymous data that we gather to help guide us in future pandemics if they arise Our data driven society is constantly adapting to solve new problems but with the increasing value and power that data holds in our modern world the privacy and security risks grow he said The voluntary app is accessible to anyone with a UT EID and allows users to gain a comprehensive view of their symptoms and see who they have been in contact with Features of the Protect Texas Together app include symptom surveys contact tracing and campus room check ins among others The University of Texas Whole Communities Whole Health grand challenge team helped design and lead the development process Established in 2016 the group focuses on using technologies to improve the wellbeing of communities From the website Our communities are becoming increasingly diverse just as we have developed the unprecedented technological ability to study health and human behavior The things we can learn and the ways we can use that knowledge to help people thrive are revolutionary Protect Texas Together is one of many methods the university is using to help minimize the risk of catching COVID 19 on campus The university is also implementing social distancing guidelines reducing building capacities and face mask

Agents Collaborate on a Shared Task Submitted by Angela Schiff on Wed 08 05 2020 5 41pm There s an albeit clich saying that says that two heads are better than one Unsurprisingly this idiom extends to artificial agents In the field of AI researchers have been working to understand how to make independent agents who may have different goals work together in an environment to complete a shared task A group of researchers in Texas Computer Science TXCS comprising Ishan Durugkar Elad Liebman and TXCS professor Peter Stone have been working to solve this problem In Balancing Individual Preferences and Shared Objectives in Multiagent Reinforcement Learning which is included in the proceedings for the 29th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence IJCAI in July the research team explores frameworks in which preferences are balanced between agents to allow for more efficient task completion Artificial agents much like humans may need to work together to solve a problem Unlike humans artificial agents don t have an innate ability to reason or cooperate Teams composed of researchers scientists and engineers must develop methods of programming an artificial agent s ability to understand the goals of both itself and others so they can become better team members While agents assigned to a task may have the same end goal such as organizing a room the tasks that they are specifically programmed for and their methods of reaching the goal could vary drastically This could lead to a group of agents that work against rather than with each other To make the process go as efficiently as possible all agents must understand and work within the parameters of the other agent s goals Durugkar illustrated the issue in terms of a band Consider a group of musicians he said Each of them might have a preference on which type of song they would like to perform but ultimately they want to entertain their audience That s where the research team s work steps in they examine how to enable agents to cooperate in such a scenario by balancing their preferences with the shared task The team taught the artificial agents by using the paradigm of reinforcement learning In a scenario where agents have a project where each agent may have a preference on how to complete the task the research team studied the behavior of these agents with varying degrees of selfishness when they tried to collaborate on a task Selfishness in this scenario meaning an artificial agent s desire to follow their individual preference rather than acquiescing to the preferences of the other agents Unexpectedly they found that in these scenarios agents being a little selfish and attempting to satisfy their individual preferences while solving the shared task actually leads to faster learning and coordination In addition they validated through experiments a way to find how much each agent should focus on its own preference as opposed to the shared task Read more about Balancing

2000 2001 and 2002 Award committee The winner of the Prize is selected by a committee of six members The Award Committee will consist of the current PODC and DISC program chairs the PODC program chairs from five and ten years ago and the DISC program chairs from five and ten years ago The Award Committee will be chaired alternately by the current PODC and DISC program chairs If the resulting committee consists of less than six distinct members because one of the specified program chairs is unable to serve on the committee or because a single person has served in the role of more than one of the specified program chairs then the committee chair will nominate a replacement of similar stature for the approval of the PODC and DISC steering committees The PODC and DISC steering committees shall be the final authority on the membership of the awards committee Nominations and eligibility At least four months prior to each year s PODC or DISC whichever comes earlier a Call for Nominations will be posted on the PODC and DISC mailing lists Nominations may be made by any member of the scientific community Each nomination must identify the paper being nominated and include a short paragraph approximately 200 words justifying the nomination Papers appearing in any conference proceedings or journal are eligible as long as they have had a significant impact on research areas of interest within the theory of distributed computing community and as long as the year of the original publication is at least ten years prior to the year in which the award is given Papers authored or co authored by members of the Award Committee will not be eligible for consideration Members of the Award Committee can nominate papers as well However they must carefully consider nominations from within the community Members of the Award Committee should be especially sensitive to conflict of interests issues if papers by former students or close colleagues are nominated members of the Award Committee cannot nominate such papers themselves Selection process Although the Award Committee is encouraged to consult with the distributed computing community at large the Award Committee is solely responsible for the selection of the winner of the award The prize may be shared by more than one paper All matters relating to the selection process that are not specified here are left to the discretion of the Award Committee Financing the award The award is financed with the combination of income from endowments and registration fees Each of ACM PODC and EATCS DISC will provide an equal share of 1 000 towards the 2 000 award at least two weeks prior to the official start date of the conference at which the prize will be awarded The PODC share is financed with income from an endowment at ACM that is based on gifts from the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory SIGACT the ACM Special Interest Group on Operating Systems SIGOPS the AT T Corporation the Hewlett Packard Company the International Business Machines IBM Corporation the Intel Corporation and Sun Microsystems Inc If the income from the endowment is insufficient to fund a year s prize the prize will be financed partially from the endowment and partially from that year s PODC budget The DISC share is financed with income from an endowment at EATCS that is based on contributions from several year s DISC budgets and gifts from Microsoft Research the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos and the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci n of Spain If the income from the endowment is insufficient to fund a year s prize the prize will be financed partially from the endowment and partially from that year s DISC budget If either PODC or DISC is unable to produce 1 000 then the value of the award will be the sum of the amounts produced Should one party PODC or DISC be unable two times to produce its 1 000 share of the award then the steering committee of the other party will have the option of revising the definition of the Award Committee and determining the venue where the award will be presented unless both parties can come to a mutually agreeable resolution Should both parties PODC and DISC be unable two times to produce the respective 1 000 then the definition of the award will be referred to ACM and EATCS for a mutually agreeable resolution PODC 2021Call for papers Program

Computing Institute Submitted by Anonymous on Wed 07 22 2020 2 29pm Illustration credit Nicolle R Fuller National Science Foundation Original story by Marc G Airhart College of Natural Sciences The University of Texas at Austin s Scott Aaronson is an initial member of a new multi institution collaboration called the NSF Quantum Leap Challenge Institute for Present and Future Quantum Computation The institute will work to overcome scientific challenges to achieving quantum computing and will design advanced large scale quantum computers that employ state of the art scientific algorithms developed by the researchers Aaronson the David J Bruton Centennial Professor of Computer Science and director of UT Austin s Quantum Information Center is one of the world s leaders in theoretical quantum computing As part of the institute he and his team will do fundamental research on the themes of quantum algorithms and quantum advantage Unlike conventional computers quantum computers seek to harness the mysterious behavior of particles at the subatomic level to boost computing power Once fully developed they will be capable of solving large extremely complex problems far beyond the capacity of today s most powerful supercomputers Quantum systems are expected to have a wide variety of applications in many fields including medicine national security and science On July 21 the National Science Foundation announced a five year 25 million award to seven universities to create the new institute UC Berkeley UCLA UC Santa Barbara the California Institute of Technology the Massachusetts Institute of Technology the University of Southern California the University of Washington and The University of Texas at Austin The new institute will be directed by UC Berkeley professor of physics Dan Stamper Kurn The institute will be multidisciplinary spanning physics chemistry mathematics optical and electrical engineering computer science and other fields and will include scientists and engineers with expertise in quantum algorithms mechanics and chemistry They will partner with outside institutions including in the emerging quantum industry and will host symposia workshops and other programs Research challenges will be addressed jointly through a process that incorporates both theory and experiment While quantum computers are likely to have an enormous impact on national and global economies and societies in the future Stamper Kurn emphasizes that several critical scientific challenges remain We still do not know fully what quantum computers do well Stamper Kurn said and we face deep challenges that arise in scaling up quantum devices The mission of this institute is to address fundamental challenges in the development of the quantum computer More information on NSF supported research on quantum information science and engineering is available at nsf gov quantum This post is based on a press release by UCLA News categories

2020 11 50am Imagine that you are a robot in a hospital composed of bolts and bits running on code and surrounded by humans It s your first day on the job and your task is to help your new human teammates the hospital s employees do their job more effectively and efficiently Mainly you re fetching things You ve never met the employees before and don t know how they handle their tasks How do you know when to ask for instructions At what point does asking too many questions become disruptive This is the core question that a team of researchers at Texas Computer Science TXCS have been trying to figure out In a paper entitled A Penny for Your Thoughts The Value of Communication in Ad Hoc Teamwork Reuth Mirsky William Macke Andy Wang Harel Yedidsion and Peter Stone investigate how to design artificial agents that can communicate in order to be valuable members in a team In A Penny for our Thoughts the research team explored the service robot example to highlight a situation where an artificial agent must learn to work with people with no prior knowledge of the collaborative environment These service robots who mainly have to retrieve supplies for physicians or nurses have two main goals to balance understanding the task specific goals of their human teammates and understanding when it is appropriate to ask questions over acting autonomously As Reuth Mirsky explains we as people are very good at that most of the time In part this is due to a human s ability to reason about other people s motives through facial cues body language language and a plethora of other explicit and non explicit cues that can communicate intent We have it hardwired in our brains that others have goals and act accordingly to accomplish them and in collaborative environments it s relatively easy to intuit how to help them or when to ask other people questions This sort of logic is something that you have to write down to the machine The subtle nuances of human interaction that make it possible for people to get along have to be observed analyzed and transcribed into a logical framework that a machine can understand To help machines understand when to ask a question or when to act on their own the team made the assumption that asking something has a specific cost To help reduce costs the team defined theoretically the times when it was not appropriate to ask at all If a robot has the same routine of checking inventory at a certain time it wouldn t be helpful to ask about the task every time as there is no ambiguity about what the robot should do it already knows the procedure and the procedure is static On the other hand when the robot is tasked with something that varies significantly from a standard routine or when the robot is given a new goal it becomes important to ask We are only interested in the window in the middle when the robot needs to ask something that is not clear and if it won t ask then it might take a wrong action said Mirsky Ultimately the team framed the problem like this In order to be useful collaborators the robot s main goal is to assist From this main goal the robot learns to choose its own goal which may be fetching an item in a certain way or assisting in a different manner So if it understands the goals of its teammates it can be a good helper The queries are about the goals of the other agents So Are you trying to do this or are you trying to do that According to the answer it gets it ll be able to act accordingly Mirsky who completed her Ph D at Ben Gurion University and had a heavy theoretical research background in the AI space wanted to work on research that has material applications in the real world She notes that with recent advancements in AI and robotics more work is being done designing human aware AI and that there is a necessity for researchers to design these types of algorithms and to design machines that are able to collaborate This desire led her to TXCS professor Peter Stone s AI Lab When I got to Peter s lab because he s doing a lot of research in these areas and he cares a lot about doing something practical and something with use in the real world she was inspired to take some of my more theoretical research and apply it to a specific problem a real problem The research team continues to study multi agent systems and plans to use the insights from the initial publication to expand upon their work A Penny for Your Thoughts The Value of Communication in Ad Hoc Teamwork will be presented at the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence IJCAI

Esther R Robards Forbes College of Natural Sciences A team of interdisciplinary researchers has discovered a new technique to store information in DNA in this case The Wizard of Oz translated into Esperanto with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency The technique harnesses the information storage capacity of intertwined strands of DNA to encode and retrieve information in a way that is both durable and compact The technique is described in a paper in this week s Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences The key breakthrough is an encoding algorithm that allows accurate retrieval of the information even when the DNA strands are partially damaged during storage said Ilya Finkelstein an associate professor of molecular biosciences and one of the authors of the study Humans are creating information at exponentially higher rates than we used to contributing to the need for a way to store more information efficiently and in a way that will last a long time Companies such as Google and Microsoft are among those exploring using DNA to store information We need a way to store this data so that it is available when and where it s needed in a format that will be readable said Stephen Jones a research scientist who collaborated on the project with Finkelstein Bill Press a professor jointly appointed in computer science and integrative biology and Ph D alumnus John Hawkins This idea takes advantage of what biology has been doing for billions of years storing lots of information in a very small space that lasts a long time DNA doesn t take up much space it can be stored at room temperature and it can last for hundreds of thousands of years DNA is about 5 million times more efficient than current storage methods Put another way a one milliliter droplet of DNA could store the same amount of information as two Walmarts full of data servers And DNA doesn t require permanent cooling and hard disks that are prone to mechanical failures There s just one problem DNA is prone to errors And when a genetic code has errors it s a lot different from when a computer code has errors Errors in computer codes tend to show up as blank spots in the code Errors in DNA sequences show up as insertions or deletions The problem there is that when something is deleted or added in DNA the whole sequence shifts with no blank spots to alert anyone Previously when information was stored in DNA the piece of information that needed to be saved such as a paragraph from a novel would be repeated 10 to 15 times When the information was read the repetitions would be compared to eliminate any insertions or deletions We found a way to build the information more like a lattice Jones said Each piece of information reinforces other pieces of information That way it only needs to be read once The language the researchers developed also avoids sections of DNA that are prone to errors or that are difficult to read The parameters of the language can also change with the type of information that is being stored For instance a dropped word in a novel is not as big a deal as a dropped zero in a tax return To demonstrate information retrieval from degraded DNA the team subjected its Wizard of Oz code to high temperatures and extreme humidity Even though the DNA strands were damaged by these harsh conditions all the information was still decoded successfully We tried to tackle as many problems with the process as we could at the same time said Hawkins who recently was with UT s Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences What we ended up with is pretty remarkable Bill Press is the Warren J and Viola M Raymer Professor in Computer Science and Integrative Biology at UT Austin and a member of the National Academy of Sciences The research was funded by a College of Natural Sciences Catalyst Grant the Welch Foundation and the National Institutes of Health News categories FacultyResearchTags molecular biologyDataDNABill Press Add new comment Your name

and Privacy Research Submitted by Angela Schiff on Tue 07 07 2020 9 02am Franziska Roesner has spent over 16 years studying and working in the computer science field Yet she only started studying computer science by pure happenstance Roesner initially applied only to The University of Texas Plan II Honors Program After realizing that the application required that she choose a backup major Roesner selected computer science without really knowing what it was Upon learning that she was accepted into both majors she went to the advising office intending to drop computer science However her advisor recommended that Roesner take some courses in the major before making a decision I m really grateful that they did that Roesner commented Roesner cites the course she took with TXCS professor Mike Scott as foundational for her burgeoning love for programming As she went along in her computer science classes she noted that I just enjoyed doing it the problem solving of programming making a computer do something and having it work It clicked with me that way of thinking Roesner has observed that so many people especially from underrepresented groups in CS have a similar story they didn t have much exposure to computer science growing up but once they discovered the discipline they fell in love with it This initial foray encouraged her to continue studying computer science which is a choice that has impacted the course of her career Though now a seasoned researcher in the field of computer security and privacy Roesner s first research experience started in her second year at UT Austin when she became a Turing Scholar In conjunction with her normal coursework she delved into researching computer architecture While she felt that this work was a great opportunity it was during this time that Roesner took a security course and she began to learn where her intellectual passions lie Roesner said that she loved learning how to adopt a security mindset that included challenging assumptions and thinking about how we might misuse things rather than just building things Security to Roesner is more of a worldview rather than a specific slice of CS The field is broad and impacts almost everybody in the world and these attributes inspired her to research security when she entered graduate school at the University of Washington Now over ten years later she continues to study various aspects of security and privacy and her contributions have earned her numerous awards such as the MIT Technology Review s Innovators Under 35 Roesner earned her PhD from the University of Washington and soon after accepted a position at the school as an assistant professor She considered taking an industry role but realized that she enjoyed working with students There s industry research but something you re missing is the student body and the energy the faculty route has this nice combination of research and teaching Currently she works as an associate professor of computer science and engineering and co directs the university s Security and Privacy Research Lab Roesner describes her research interests as covering the whole spectrum of things from how we should design systems to be more secure to how people interact with computing systems and what their security expectations are and everything in between The same security mindset that Roesner embraced during her undergraduate education still fuels her work today She enjoys studying both how people use technology and the unexpected ways that technologies can be misused with the ultimate goal of figuring out how to fix potential problems and make them safer When deciding on which research projects to tackle Roesner looks at which trends are currently relevant and what sectors need to be looked at from a research perspective For an example just look at her work on augmented reality AR and security While researching security and privacy issues on AR platforms Roesner said that the core question for her team was what was new about these platforms With burgeoning technologies such as AR the answers do not exist As technological innovations continue to grow and accelerate at unprecedented speeds it s crucial for researchers to examine the security and privacy implications so they can design more secure platforms In the case of AR and security Roesner s team worked toward creating solutions to these new problems Roesner summed up her research ethos as such You have to understand what the right problems are and the constraints that people are working under We want to push technical innovations but we also want to make sure we re working on things that solve real problems Sometimes the real problems come from those constraints Roesner s recent research publications include Smart Devices in Airbnbs Considering Privacy and Security for both Guests and Hosts and Bad News Clickbait and Deceptive Ads on News and Misinformation Websites More information about her work can be found

Forged to Transform Data Science Submitted by Anonymous on Wed 06 24 2020 1 45pm Note the original article was written for and published on the Texas Advanced Computing Center website Authorship credit goes to Faith Singer Villalobos By 2025 the global high performance computing HPC market is forecasted to account for 50 billion up 15 billion from 2019 Fueled by the growth of big data artificial intelligence and 3 D imaging HPC is increasingly used to drive commercial industrial and personal usage Scientists and users in industry alike are increasingly applying HPC infrastructures such as compute clusters networking and storage to support big data applications These applications utilize larger more complex data sets that can overwhelm traditional data processing resources As the proportion of supercomputer cycles devoted to big data fields such as machine learning fMRI and experimental particle physics analyses grows the workloads of HPC and big data are converging and require hardware and software resources capable of supporting each on equal footing To address this challenge in today s HPC data centers a new partnership has been forged among the Portuguese Foundation of Science and Technology and The University of Texas at Austin UT Austin specifically the UT Austin Portugal program the Texas Advanced Computing Center TACC and the Department of Computer Science Wavecom a private wireless company in Portugal is leading the effort and plans to market the outcomes to the computing community in Portugal and beyond The project BigHPC A Management Framework for Consolidated Big Data and HPC started in April 2020 and includes 2 million in funding over the next three years It s an honor that we were selected to work with Portugal on this important project said Vijay Chidambaram one of two principal investigators on the grant and a professor in the Department of Computer Science at UT Austin The UT Austin Portugal program dates back to 2007 and is one of several partnerships between the Portuguese government and research institutions The program s goal is to elevate science and technology in Portugal while fostering strong partnerships to help universities continue to innovate The partnership with UT Austin was extended in 2018 continuing the alliance until at least 2030 The idea of the BigHPC grant is to focus on practical R D that will lead to real applications for scientists whether they re in industry academia or a national lab and transfer that knowledge into the commercial sector said Todd Evans who is a member of TACC s HPC Performance Architectures Group and the second principal investigator on the grant The project will also contribute to building the much needed capacity to implement and manage HPC and big data services in academia and industry Evans said The result will be a novel solution for monitoring and managing the infrastructure data and applications of current and next generation HPC data centers while ensuring the best performance and resource usage for applications and infrastructures It will also enable both big data analytics applications and traditional HPC to be deployed using heterogeneous hardware and run in the same environment Experts from TACC and the Minho Advanced Computing Centre MACC in Portugal will help integrate the tools developed into a single software bundle that will be validated through real use cases and a pilot deployed in both the TACC and MACC data centers The project will also leverage the expertise in HPC and big data management of researchers from the Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering Technology and Science a Portuguese non profit that acts as an interface between academia and industry and the Laboratory of Instrumentation and Experimental Particle Physics a state run Portuguese research laboratory founded in 1986 When a scientist conducts computational research good results depend on the efficiency of the underlying infrastructure This was highlighted when researchers at UT Austin recently mapped the spread of COVID 19 The COVID 19 research translated into tasks that were run on TACC s supercomputers Chidambaram said If we can make the systems in TACC s data center more efficient we will directly speed up how long it takes to run these tasks This helps researchers conducting science decrease time to solution MODERN DAY HPC CHALLENGES Academic and industry data centers are rising to meet new challenges in the HPC environment Chidambaram says the two primary challenges are managing new heterogeneous storage and virtualization technologies in data centers in an efficient manner and the fact that traditional software needs to be modified to work with new storage technologies HPC has been focused on very traditional techniques that have been around for more than 30 years Chidambaram said These techniques are often not well suited to new hardware For example persistent memory is a new capability that provides very low latency access to data but also has very unique characteristics If you used persistent memory like you would a magnetic hard drive you re not going to get all the benefit you can from that device Chidambaram added Similarly in terms of virtualization technologies back when HPC really took off there wasn t a notion of running containers This is widespread in the field now Containers are a method of packaging an application with many software components along with complex dependencies to run high end applications They have altered the development of software today because they hide the complexity and make the deployment easier Coping with heterogeneous hardware large scale infrastructure and the different HPC application requirements is challenging Evans said Even if an application exists and is vetted it can be extremely labor intensive to modify it to run in a particular environment or on a particular system Secondly it s challenging to build an application such that it s taking advantage of the hardware capabilities that are available to it Chidambaram s lab the UT Systems and Storage Lab is working to build the next generation of storage technologies To do this effectively he needs partners It s one thing to generally know what HPC requires It s quite another thing to talk directly to the people who are managing the clusters and data centers Chidambaram said TACC is excited to be involved Evans said It gives us an opportunity to think in a deeper way about virtualization specifically container technologies that are becoming more prevalent You can t practically build some of these packages from scratch anymore particularly in relatively restrictive HPC environments so you need containers to support applications Evans continued This project is going a step further by sharing container supported applications that are able to run in an optimal way for a given hardware configuration Many areas of the overall scientific community will benefit from the BigHPC grant academic supercomputing centers industrial data centers national labs and nonprofits Chidambaram concluded Typically these proposals are only academic In this instance we have TACC and MACC to provide on the ground experience running supercomputers in an educational setting for research We have Wavecom to talk with us about industrial productions problems And we have non profits experienced in bridging academic and industrial efforts We re all hoping to learn how best to manage data centers now and in the future and how best we can use storage and virtualization technologies Our collaborators will tell us whether our ideas make sense and work in the real world News categories

Graph Mining System on CPU and GPU Submitted by Spoorthi Krishnaraj on Thu 06 11 2020 3 00pm The datasets used by many software applications can be represented as graphs defined by sets of vertices and edges These graphs are rich with useful information and can be used to determine patterns and relationships among the stored data This process of discovering relevant patterns from graphs is called Graph Pattern Mining GPM A team of Texas Computer Science TXCS researchers advised by Dr Keshav Pingali has done groundbreaking work to make GPM programs more efficient and accessible Their work was recently accepted to Very Large Databases VLDB 2020 one of the premier conferences in computer science GPM has applications in many areas including chemical engineering bioinformatics and social sciences For example protein behavior can be mapped to a graph by representing the proteins as the vertices and the interactions between them as edges Using a GPM program researchers would be able to make useful discoveries about the data such as finding frequent patterns that occur within the graph and what features they relate to This information would then shine light on the etiology of a disease and enhance drug discovery The applications of these programs are seemingly endless However GPM problems are computationally complicated memory intensive and time consuming to solve Although a lot of work has been done to attempt to make it easy for programmers to develop GPM applications these solutions are generally not very efficient or flexible using distributed systems or disks to manage the intermediate data structures The TXCS research team decided to find a streamlined approach to solve GPM problems through using a single multi core CPU or a single GPU and utilizing the memory and computation resources available on the hardware to their maximum potential Our system handles all the complexities regarding parallelization synchronization memory management and so on says Dr Roshan Dathathri a collaborator on the project So the programmer only has to specify the application logic what are they trying to find what are they trying to mine from the graphs The system they developed called Pangolin provides a simple programming interface to do this At the moment Pangolin runs efficiently on a single multi core CPU or a single GPU but its functionality still has room to grow The goal is to enable larger graphs and also larger patterns that could be mined within a reasonable amount of time says Dr Xuhao Chen the project s lead researcher Their paper is set to be published in VLDB at the end of the month News categories Research Add new comment Your name E mail The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly Homepage Comment 2317

Jeanette Bohg Stanford FAI Talk Jeanette Bohg Stanford Leveraging Language in Learning Robot Manipulation Skills Location https utexas zoom us j 97586304443Audience Faculty Graduate Students Undergraduate Students Outside Interested Parties Alumni Abstract Humans have gradually developed language mastered complex motor skills created and utilized sophisticated tools The act of conceptualization is fundamental to these abilities because it allows humans to mentally represent summarize and abstract diverse knowledge and skills By means of abstraction concepts that we learn from a limited number of examples can be extended to a potentially infinite set of new and unanticipated situations My long term goal is to endow robots with this generalization ability In this talk I will present work that gives robots the ability to acquire a variety of manipulation concepts that act as mental representations of verbs in a natural language instruction We propose to use learning from human demonstrations of manipulation actions as recorded in large scale video data sets that are annotated with natural language instructions Specifically we propose to use a video classifier that scores how well the robot imitates the human actions This approach alleviates the need for hand designing rewards and for time consuming processes such as teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching In extensive simulation experiments we show that the policy learned in the proposed way can perform a large percentage of the 78 different manipulation tasks on which it was trained The tasks are of greater variety and complexity than previously considered collections of robotic manipulation tasks We show that the policy generalizes over variations of the environment We also show examples of successful generalization over novel but similar instructions Bio Jeannette Bohg is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University She was a group leader at the Autonomous Motion

developed language mastered complex motor skills created and utilized sophisticated tools The act of conceptualization is fundamental to these abilities because it allows humans to mentally represent summarize and abstract diverse knowledge and skills By means of abstraction concepts that we learn from a limited number of examples can be extended to a potentially infinite set of new and unanticipated situations My long term goal is to endow robots with this generalization ability In this talk I will present work that gives robots the ability to acquire a variety of manipulation concepts that act as mental representations of verbs in a natural language instruction We propose to use learning from human demonstrations of manipulation actions as recorded in large scale video data sets that are annotated with natural language instructions Specifically we propose to use a video classifier that scores how well the robot imitates the human actions This approach alleviates the need for hand designing rewards and for time consuming processes such as teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching In extensive simulation experiments we show that the policy learned in the proposed way can perform a large percentage of the 78 different manipulation tasks on which it was trained The tasks are of greater variety and complexity than previously considered collections of robotic manipulation tasks We show that the policy generalizes over variations of the environment We also show examples of successful generalization over novel but similar instructions Bio Jeannette Bohg is

Berant Tel Aviv University Improving Compositional Generalization with Latent Tree Structures Location https utexas zoom us j 96099735688Audience Faculty Graduate Students Undergraduate Students Outside Interested Parties Alumni Abstract A recent focus in machine learning and natural language processing is on models that generalize beyond their training distribution One natural form of such generalization which humans excel in is compositional generalization the ability to generalize at test time to new unobserved compositions of atomic components that were observed at training time Recent work has shown that current models struggle to generalize in such scenarios In this talk I will present recent work which demonstrates how an inductive bias towards tree structures substantially improves compositional generalization in two question answering setups First we present a model that given a compositional question and an image constructs a tree over the input question and answers the question from the root representation Trees are not given at training time and are fully induced from the answer supervision only We show that our approach improves compositional generalization on the CLOSURE dataset from 72 2 96 1 accuracy while obtaining comparable performance to models such as FILM and MAC on human authored questions Second we present a span based semantic parser which induces a tree over the input to compute an output logical form handling a certain sub class of non projective trees We evaluate this on several compositional splits of existing datasets improving performance on Geo880 e g from 54 0 82 2 Overall we view these results as strong evidence that an inductive bias towards tree structures dramatically improves compositional generalization compared to existing approaches Bio My field of research is Natural Language Processing I work on Natural Language Understanding problems such as Semantic Parsing Question Answering Paraphrasing Reading Comprehension and Textual Entailment I am mostly excited about learning from weak supervision that is easy to obtain and grounded in the world and in tasks that require multi step inference or

click View all Outlook settings then find the forwarding option and configure your forwarding for the austin utexas edu address Permalink What is the name of the CS POP Post Office Protocol and IMAP Internal Mail Access Protocol server The SMTP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol server All POP IMAP users should use mailbox2 cs utexas edu as their incoming server Note that in general CS recommends the use of IMAP instead of POP especially if you check mail from multiple computers and or mobile devices The SMTP server is mail2 cs utexas edu For complete details see our Email Configuration page Permalink What causes Relaying denied Proper Authentication required This means you are trying to send mail via the UTCS SMTP server but the user name and password is either missing or misconfigured See our Email Configuration page for details on how to set this up Note that the new SMTP server mail2 cs utexas edu no longer requires you to use a different password from the one you use to retrieve email Permalink How does the procmail setup in the CS department work Why can I not forward email or execute programs during delivery via my procmailrc The CS department install of procmail which filters your mail upon delivery is specially configured for our environment It is set up as usual via your procmailrc file but with two caveats You may not run a program from your procmailrc This is to protect our mailserver and thus your mailbox not only from deliberately malicious actions but also from accidental misconfigurations which would swamp the server Since our mail server does not allow user logins for the same reasons this is an extension of existing policy You may not forward mail to another user via the mechanism in a procmail recipe This is to protect the mail server from the high load and eventual meltdown that can be caused by a mail loop With these restrictions in mind the main use of procmail during message delivery at CS is to filter your mail in real time into different folders based on headers such as the score it received from our spam analysis system the sender a mailing list specific header or the subject Since we have disabled execute and forward functionality in procmail during delivery we suggest using the example in the procmail 1 man page for a template in creating your own post processing scripts The version of procmail in lusr bin which you can run manually does not suffer these limitations Search for the third occurrence of the string cron in this man page to find the example script Two changes you will need to make to that script are to change the ORGMAIL variable to point to the actual location of the folder and to provide a separate procmail recipe file to the executed version of procmail in the script the line formail s procmail newmail will need to be changed to formail s procmail path to your recipefile newmail These scripts can be run periodically via the cron 1 command to do the actions automatically or you can run them before you read mail to do something like filter out the messages or text you don t like PLEASE NOTE To avoid clobbering mail folders make sure all recipes start with 0 not just 0 The procmailrc 1 and procmail 1 manpages have more details Permalink Why has sending mail from my home computer suddenly stopped working While there may be any number of reasons for the failure many ISPs and organizations block outbound network traffic on port 25 the SMTP port that mail servers use to communicate with each other as one method of stopping spam If you are using CS s server for your outgoing mail server we recommend you use port 587 the Submission port with STARTTLS turned on For more information see our Email Configuration page if you still encounter problems sending mail please do not hesitate to email help cs utexas edu and we will try to help you resolve the problem Permalink I ve got a mail message with the subject DON T DELETE THIS MESSAGE FOLDER INTERNAL DATA and the body says not to delete the message or important data will be lost What s going on The POP IMAP servers and some mail reader software anything that uses the c client library use this dummy message to maintain state over time Because our POP IMAP server recognizes this message as containing metadata it doesn t send it to POP IMAP clients such as Apple Mail or Thunderbird so you ll normally never see it But if you use an email client that doesn t recognize this as a special message it will show it to you as a regular message It s true that if you delete the message you may lose important information such as whether messages are read unread whether they ve been seen at all by the client which could lead a POP client to duplicate some messages etc Permalink How do I authenticate with the CS SMTP mail server The newer SMTP server mail2 cs utexas edu no longer requires a separate SMTP email password so you will simply use your standard CS account password See our Email Configuration page for more details Permalink How can I use webmail with my CS mailbox You have several options You can use the CS webmail to connect to your CS mail account Simply log in using your CS account and password You can use a third party webmail system such as Outlook com GMail or Yahoo Specific instructions for setting this up will vary by webmail provider so it s beyond our ability to support but googling for other email account and the name of the provider should get you pointed in the right direction Note that many of these only allow POP access to your CS email account so if you plan to still use other email software to access your CS email choose the settings in your webmail provider s configuration carefully leave email on server in particular Forward your mail to a separate offsite address which already provides webmail such as those mentioned above as well as others Permalink How do I set up my account so that it automatically sends out a message stating that I am on

not really a way to opt out of using the spam filter but users do have the ability to tune how aggressively the filter behaves on mail sent to you In your user directory there is a hidden directory named spamassassin and Inside of that is a text file called user prefs there are other files too but you should leave those alone Using a text editor you can add one of the following lines to the end of the file whitelist to your email address more spam to your email address all spam to your email address These choice are list in order of how much spam will be allowed through the filter where the first will be a fair amount the second will allow most spam through and the third will let in all but the most egregious spam If you are turning off the spam filter because you have found it to be making mistakes either false positive or false negative please email nospam cs utexas edu we want to know Permalink A piece of spam got through your filter What should I do with it Our spam filtering relies partly on a bayesian filter which requires constant training to keep up with the ever changing tactics of spammers You can help us by sending a complete copy of your spam emails to nospam cs

character output from ls looks like ile you might try something like rm i ile which will also work for commands other than rm grep for instance Permalink What is public software I m having trouble with a program installed in p bin type which programname to find out where something is installed How do I install software in public The public software is anything installed in the p or public directory typically actual programs are in p bin This software is installed by non staff students researchers or professors and is not monitored installed or maintained by the staff if you re having trouble with a particular program contact the person who installed that package as shown by ls l directly or email public cs utexas edu which is a mailing list of all people who maintain programs in public If you want to enable your account to install software in public email help cs utexas edu and they ll add you to the group and mailing list Permalink Why does find take so long How do I find a file in the filesystem knowing its name How do I use locate How do I use find Please don t use find as it s very slow and a real drain on the network Use locate by typing locate string where string is the name of the file you want to find or part of the name It s more appropriate to use find to find something in a fairly small area such as your home directory or a projects directory neither of which are searched by locate The basic find syntax is find path to search expression to search for please read the man page for find for more detailed information Permalink I just accidentally deleted something I need or just realized I need something I deleted a while ago What can I do now First you should try recovering the file from snapshots yourself to learn how view the documentation on recovering files from snapshots If that fails email help cs utexas edu and ask them to restore your files Include the following information When did you delete the file s When did you create the file s Not recently is enough When did you last change the file s before the day you deleted it them Permalink How can I check how much disk space I m using Is there a command to check how much disk space is being used by a user You can check your quota usage with the chkquota command You can find out how much disk space is in a particular directory such as someone s home directory with the command du sk if you have permissions on that directory if it s yours or if it s world readable Permalink World Wide Web How do I go about setting up a web page How do I use CGI scripts on my web page How do I embed Java code For most common questions about setting up a web page and putting scripts images links etc in it in the CS domain see the documentation on using the web Permalink Can I use PHP Yes We only support PHP5 not PHP4 A mod php script should have the suffix php and no line A CGI script should invoke usr bin php5 cgi at the top and have the cgi suffix For more information see the documentation on using the web The PHP documentation is available at http www php net Permalink How do I make my web pages readable only by certain people Can I protect my web page with a password Yes You can use dynamic configuration files using an htaccess file to restrict access to documents in your web directory For more information on this see the documentation on using the web Permalink Is there some way to have a cgi script run on the CS webserver as my own UID rather than the one belonging to the webserver software By default CGI scripts running on our server execute as the web user www this user has no special permissions Thus the directory in which the script resides must be world searchable the script must be world executable and files read or written by the script must be world readable or world writable In certain applications you may prefer that a script execute with your Unix account permissions so as to access protected data We provide a Secure CGI mechanism for doing this Warning Please carefully weigh your need for this feature against the security risks of a script running with the full permissions of your user account You are responsible for the use of that account whether by your own hand by someone using a workstation where you left yourself logged in or by someone exploiting a poorly written script which you have made available on the Web You may wish to review our policies The basic guidelines for setting up a secure CGI script are Full script pathnames should contain only printing ASCII characters They should not contain relative path components Script directories should be searchable by the owner and have the same owner group as the script file They should not be writable by anyone other than the owner Script files should be a regular file not a symlink be executable by the owner and have the extension scgi They should not be setuid or setgid or writable by anyone other than the owner Other notes Non parsed header scripts may be used with the usual nph prefix Access control directives in a htaccess file will not work for a scgi script Normally this is not a problem since the script is typically the action associated with a form in a html file which can be access controlled Of course the script is at liberty to implement any authentication for itself that it chooses Permalink I ve figured out how to set up my web page but how can I be sure that it will be programatically correct and available to the maximum number of readers This is a tough question there is definitely some content such as sounds and images which will never be universally available to blind or deaf users However for the most part staying standards compliant and making sure that your pages have no syntax errors or dependency on a specific browser is the best way to be sure of reaching the widest possible audience The canonical reference for the most popular and most widely supported markup languages HTML and XHTML is published by the World Wide Web Consortium This documentation is the agreed upon standard for web markup across the entire internet It is likely to be supported by all browsers from cell phones and text only browsers for the blind to the latest version of Internet Explorer To be sure you ve created pages that not only meet the standards but fail to have any content impairing typos you should probably run them through the XHTML and HTML validator and potentially through the CSS validator as well if you have used cascading style sheets for further page layout Be warned that older or less capable browsers may not support CSS so do try reading your page without the CSS in the source to see if all text displays fully and legibly in its absence Although it is popular to write browser specific code targetting IE or mozilla netscape and although such code may work on the majority of the browsers available today you do limit your site s usefulness by doing so Consider whether you think the cute tricks with the cursor or ActiveX controls are worth someone not being able to find the link to your resume or research Old small and handicapped accessible browsers may be unable to use your site and often will just ignore it instead of informing you The Viewable With Any Browser campaign may serve to further enlighten you as to the rationale behind creating more compatible web pages Do consider making your page fully handicapped accessible Permalink X Window System If I have a UNIX machine running X windows at home how can I run an application on the CS machines and have it display to my home computer If your computer is connected to the internet you can run ssh X hostname where hostname is the name of the computer that you want to log into The X flag enables X forwarding You can then run X applications within that ssh window and they will display on your local desktop For further information such as getting this to work on the Windows operating system see the SSH X Forwarding documentation page VNC is also available although we generally discourage its use when X forwarding is an option Permalink What window managers are available on the UNIX machines How can I use them There are a number of options available for your use Some of the choices are Fvwm GNOME KDE LXDE Openbox Window Maker and Xfce You can set your window manager by clicking on the foot drop box on the login screen Permalink I ve logged into the UNIX machines in the lab but when my windows manager starts I am getting a blank screen or messed up tool bars How can I fix this If you have logged into our UNIX machines before they were all updated to Trusty you may need to remove your old config files for the windows manager you are using You can use Ctrl Alt F1 Ctrl Alt F7 or F8 will get you back to the graphical login screen to get to a virtual console and the dotfiles directories in question are gnome gnome2 gnome2 private gconf and gconfd kde kde and kderc xfce config gconf and gconfd Permalink I am trying to use MATLAB but whenever I open it all I am getting is a blank screen How do I fix this If you are using gnome as your windows manager and you try to use MATLAB you may run into this issue To fix the problem go to System Menu Preferences Appearance then select the Visual Effects tab Set the effects to None and close the window MATLAB should behave normally once this is done Permalink 2317 Speedway Stop D9500 Austin TX 78712 Phone 512 471 7316 The University of Texas at Austin 2020 Undergraduate Office Graduate Office Office of External Affairs Webmaster Mission

Continuity and working from home You are hereHome Facilities Laptop Encryption University policy requires all UT owned laptop computers as well as personally owned laptops containing Category I data to have their contents encrypted This policy is intended to secure sensitive data and to prevent its release in the event of theft or loss Encrypting your laptop s contents is mandatory if the machine is UT owned or contains Category I data STEP 1 Backup Backing up your laptop s data is critical for this process Once the data is encrypted if the encryption key or password is lost the contents cannot be retrieved If there is a serious hardware or software failure during the encryption process the contents could be lost Be sure to perform a full system backup of your laptop s contents before installing the encryption software The Computer Science Department offers a free service for backing up user data on portable computers purchased on departmental funds using CrashPlan Pro Enterprise software Information about this service and software downloads are available at the portable computer backup service page The service is designed for backing up the files contained in the user s home directory not a complete snapshot of the entire disk including operating system For this reason we recommend that you have a separate system backup image before encrypting your disk The service is free for use by CS Department faculty staff and graduate students For maximum safety if the CS Department staff is encrypting your UT owned laptop we will make a snapshot image of the drive before proceeding You should still have a regular backup system in place regardless STEP 2 Encrypt The ISO has provided a list of approved encryption solutions for UT use If you decide to encrypt your laptop yourself once you have downloaded the software for your computer pick a time to install it when you can leave the computer plugged in and unused for several hours and install the software If your computer is owned by the University the CS Department staff can perform the installation and initial encryption process on it If you d like us to perform this task send mail to helpreq cs utexas edu to arrange a time STEP 3 Keep Backing Up Now that your laptop is encrypted it s important to keep current backups of its contents If something happens to the disk you don t want to lose any changes you ve made since the installation of the encryption software We are happy to assist with this process If you have questions about the laptop encryption process or what will be required of you please

field field name body field type text with summary field label hidden div class field items div class field item even property content encoded p Alumnus a href https www linkedin com in kuhlmanngj Greg Kuhlmann a was introduced to computers and programming by his family at a young age During Kuhlmann s childhood his grandfather taught him how to program on his VIC 20 when he was just six years old and his father would take him to Amiga Users Group meetings The ability offered by programming to change bits of code and see a new outcome right before his eyes was what really drew Kuhlmann in Unbeknownst to him he would go on to earn a graduate degree in computer science and start his own cybersecurity startup p p During his undergraduate studies at UCLA Kuhlmann became particularly interested in artificial intelligence automated theorem and areas of math which he had never encountered before This solidified the decision to continue his studies at The University of Texas at Austin which was spurred on by the Department of Computer Science s national ranking and the fact that he completely fell in love with Austin s lush and green cityscape p p As a graduate student Kuhlmann worked with a href https www cs utexas edu people faculty researchers vladimir lifschitz Vladimir Lifschitz a in his first year and then with a href https www cs utexas edu people faculty researchers peter stone Peter Stone a for the remainder of his time at UT Kuhlmann worked as a lead scientist for 21st Century Technologies where he applied machine learning and intelligent agent techniques to unmanned systems and data mining problems While pursuing his PhD at UT Kuhlmann was also involved with the a href https www cs utexas edu AustinVilla sim 3dsimulation Austin Villa Robot Soccer Team a which he has fond memories of He recalls the long nights spent working on the robots and the solidarity between him and his teammates that arose from them At two o clock in the morning you finally get it to work and you just feel such a bond with your fellow teammates that you ve been working on this thing together Nothing brings people together more than this sort of common struggle p p The idea of helping individuals remained a driving point in Kuhlmann s life upon receiving his PhD He worked as a data scientist at Apple for 9 years where the importance of both personal and professional connections was solidified for him You re helping these millions of people you re saving this company millions of dollars you re bringing a better customer experience to hundreds of millions of people and those numbers just feel too abstract Kuhlmann said He says that the thing that brought him the most satisfaction was being able to help people not just the big companies and corporations I realized that the thing I contributed that day made their life a little bit easier Kuhlmann said p p Now Kuhlmann is the Co Founder and CEO of Sumatra his Austin based self funded startup that provides Anti Fraud and Trust amp Safety as a Service He was inspired to start his company after realizing that sophisticated anti fraud systems used at big companies like Uber Apple and Facebook aren t widely available to smaller companies that could benefit just as much from them He saw those big companies go to conferences and talk about their sophisticated anti fraud systems But none of these systems are actually available more widely You realize that most of what is going on out there in the world is not just those big players Kuhlmann said He decided to step in and help bridge that gap p p At his startup Kuhlmann is able to continue utilizing both the teamwork and technical skills he was able to hone during his time at TXCS His expertise in data science and operations help companies at the next tier avoid scammers bullying harassment and all the different kinds of things that can happen in an ecosystem that makes for a bad customer experience His vision is to work with his team to assist these smaller companies succeed at a level that is traditionally reserved for the big names in tech His passion for helping people and smaller companies at a closer level continues to thrive within his vision for a future in which anti fraud systems are more widely available and accessible p p Currently his team is working to build the tools that will aid smaller companies to avoid fraud with an emphasis on anti fraud education and instruction The team realized that these tools are only as effective as people knowing how to use them Now we re at this point moving forward and we re adding a new element to it which is the training part of it as well So to really democratize this idea of trust and safety data science we need both better tooling and better training And that s what we re trying to bring together now Kuhlmann said As for what the future holds Kuhlmann plans on doing what he is passionate about for as long as possible In true data scientist wording he wants to make sure he s doing whatever he s doing 1 better every day and then taking advantage of the compound interest of that Whether it is at a personal level or at a corporate level Kuhlmann wants to help the people and projects he cares about to succeed p div div div div class field field name field news categories field type taxonomy term reference field label above div

fellow senior and close friend Am rica Quistiano She is president of the a href http texashacs org rel nofollow Hispanic Association of Computer Scientists a HACS which has similar aims for Hispanic and Latinx students Together these two leaders drafted plans to bring about social change for students at the departmental level p p Black and Hispanic Latinx students have been historically underrepresented in STEM fields and today computer science is no different As the leaders of their respective organizations Collins and Quistiano saw firsthand how underserved and underrepresented students were personally affected Many of their members were the first in their families to pursue a technical degree or any degree at all and they were struggling in their high school to college transitions Meanwhile other members had to work multiple jobs on top of full time enrollment to support themselves financially Collins and Quistiano saw these challenges and wanted to help and support

reason or another it just never worked out p p While Collins and Quistiano were working on their plans a href https www cs utexas edu rel nofollow UT s Department of Computer Science a was actually at work behind the scenes establishing similar initiatives These initiatives were in line with those proposed by longtime department staff members Amy Bush and Kay Nettle who wanted to help start a scholarship to aid more of those students who had the ability but not the means to study computer science at UT With the department matching Bush and Nettle s funds the mutual goals of the students staff and department came together to create the Texas Computer Science Endowment for Change p p We have been part of the computer science department as students and employees for over 50 years combined and we ve seen it change in many ways Helping promote diversity in a department that has meant so much to both of us is a pretty amazing legacy said Bush and Nettle p p Beginning this year the endowment will support diversity and inclusion efforts and fund opportunities for underserved students with a demonstrated passion for technology p p Being a first generation student myself growing up there wasn t really anyone for me or many of these students to ask about computer science Quistiano said I was laughably unaware of how the tech industry worked and the academics of it all For example for the longest time I thought there was only like one technology major to give you one technology job Quistiano said that she and Collins hoped to create a network of support and mutual understanding among these students p p While ABCS and HACS do just that the two leaders saw that it wasn t enough for those who were struggling financially They wanted to do more and saw this project as an opportunity to get the department to better acknowledge these students and understand their perspectives p p Diversity s not just who you admit but also who has the support to stay and actually successfully complete their degree Collins said Brent Winkelman chief of staff of the department wholeheartedly agrees citing the department s long standing focus on not just recruitment but also long term retention which many institutions may overlook p p There are occasions when we may successfully recruit a student but then the student gets in and discovers Gosh this environment is just not a home for me Winkelman explained As a department we re committed to doing the work to ensure that no student has that reaction We want this to be a place where everyone can feel comfortable and welcome

Am rica Quistiano width 768 height 576 div p Winkelman said that there are a number of initiatives in the works directed toward diversity and inclusion and that the department is looking to scale up programs such as a href https www cs utexas edu outreach camps first bytes rel nofollow First Bytes a a camp designed to expose high school women to futures in computer science and a href https www cs utexas edu outreach camps code longhorn rel nofollow Code Longhorn a a similar program designed for underrepresented populations throughout Texas p p These initiatives are great because what starts here changes the world right But how can you change the world if the people creating and building new things are not actually representative of the world if not everyone is included in that discussion Quistiano asked p p As for the beginnings of the new endowment Collins said they conducted extensive research on their own time into budgeting editing writing and drafting proposals They reached out to computer science professor Alison Norman who is also chair of the department s Diversity and Inclusion Committee for mentorship and guidance p p Norman was not at all surprised when Collins and Quistiano contacted her Our students are amazing she said They re hardworking and caring and they really want to have a positive effect on the world and are always hungry for information about just how to do that p p Norman provided advice and proofread their early drafts We wanted to be as best prepared as we could be before any sort of archetypal proposal Collins said Alison helped our efforts immensely and we were very persistent she said laughing p p After the department learned of Collins and Quistiano s ideas both sides worked together I think that everybody s goals were aligned and then it was just a matter of how to best achieve those goals said Norman of the project Soon enough their persistence and the hard work of the staff and faculty paid off Many many presentations virtual meetings discussions and considerations later the endowment was officially established and it started in fall 2020 p p Today the endowment is listed on a href https hornraiser utexas edu

computer science students who have participated in Code Longhorn or who are current or future members of HACS or ABCS p p The effort for diversity and inclusion has always been there student org wise Collins said but what I wanted to establish is that once I graduate and leave the computer science department the staff actual department and administration they re now the ones leading the charge p p Quistiano added This is just the beginning Hopefully the endowment will grow and provide support for generations of future students to come and that s the mark we want to leave p p And the university is proud to uphold that legacy UT houses a lot of world class students in terms of their talent and abilities and also in their desire to have a positive impact Winkelman said And I think that we have seen that repeatedly from students like Audra and Am rica who have asked the department to think more ambitiously about how we can create change p p p div class video filter iframe src www youtube com

Cuzco Peru a these UT Austin researchers set out to understand how the increase of tourism and social media intersects with heritage regulations to aid in the creation of travel patterns across Cuzco s heritage landscape Additionally they embarked to study and document how social media has affected tourists aesthetic preferences and expectations p p Tourism in Cuzco Peru the former capital of the Incan empire began in the early 1900s following an expedition by Hiram Bingham By the 1920s government officials realized the economic potential of tourism in Cuzco and began funding the restoration of regional archaeological sites for tourism Since then tourism in Cuzco has taken off Today annual visits in the region top 3 million with heritage tourism tourism that involves traveling to places of cultural significance being a major draw By the late 70s tourist initiatives were being created to promote and popularize tourism in Cuzco s prominent archaeological sites including the creation of the original Boleto Turistico BTC tourist package in 1978 and the promotion of the Inca trail to Machu Picchu Over time these initiatives included packaged day trip itineraries to some Cuzco s more remote archaeological sites p p In their research Nicole D Payntar Wei Lin Hsiao R Alan Covey and Kristen Grauman collected 57 804 images from community internet photos shared on social media sites captured across 12 archaeological sites in the Cuzco region Through the use of geo tagging technology they were able to detect patterns of tourist movement at these sites and analyze how they ve changed over time AI technology also enabled them to categorize tourist images based on common themes such as mountains stonework alpaca terracing etc p p From this dataset spanning 2004 2019 these UT Austin researchers were able to bring to light some insightful patterns of tourists in Cuzco Peru They uncovered which sites were the most popular sites in the area the least visited and which sites people spent the most time at The data and geo tagging technology also allowed them to be able to track tourist patterns and determine how tourists moved across these archaeological sites Additionally the researchers were able to determine which type of aesthetic tourists were capturing in their pictures at each site These results led them to conclude that policies in the region have definitely affected how tourists interact with the sites The introduction of the day passes influenced how tourists travel across the region and conservation initiatives and regulations at larger tourist sites led to an increase in photo homogeneity while smaller sites with less regulation had much more diverse pictures The data also showed that the most popular pictures of the Cuzco region shared similar aesthetic qualities with the historic photographs published by Hiram Bingham in the early 20th Century This shows that heritage aesthetics remain pretty similar over time due to the visual reproduction of what is meant to be seen based on perceived experiences and audience consumption p p A study like this would not be possible if it were not for the rise of social media technologies and innovations in AI specifically applied computer vision and machine learning algorithms Due to our increasing online presence researchers are gaining access to more information about patterns in our lives than ever before AI plays an equally important role as it allows researchers to categorize and identify patterns in this immense amount of data The project would have been impossible to

reins of the podcast to our science writing intern Cason Hunwick He explores what artificial intelligence might teach us about how hyenas in Africa evolved a surprising hunting tactic Along the way you ll learn about an area of computer science called computational evolution where machines evolve solutions in response to complex problems and a lot more quickly than we living things can do Cason spoke with computer scientists Padmini Rajagopalan and Risto Miikkulainen from The University of Texas at Austin p p Cason Hunwick Imagine you re in a grassy African savannah the sun s hanging low just about to set but then you hear a lion You look over and see a lion standing over a zebra carcass There s blood and torn striped flesh in its mouth It s clear that the hunt is over and this is dinner But wait a spotted hyena has just approached the lion hoping to do what you just thought was impossible and steal some of the lion s kill It lunges for the zebra carcass But the lion makes a precise powerful strike and sends the hyena screeching and running Of course for a solo hyena to try this is pretty foolhardy and in attempting to steal prey from the lion it could easily become it p p CH But in groups spotted hyenas have found a way to steal the kill and walk away without a scratch scot free full stomachs They group up and execute a coordinated attack on the lions in a cooperative behavior known as mobbing Back on the savannah let s listen in as a collaborator of two UT computer scientists Michigan State University professor of integrative biology Kay Holekamp looks on at the behavior She is joined by a member of her lab Erin who provides the play by play in this recording of a successful mobbing event in Kenya Erin counts the approaching hyenas p p Erin one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen Fourteen hyenas p p CH Two more join and it becomes a frenzy p p Erin There s a mob kind of circled the lions they ve all clustered up over there p p Cason And finally they all rush together p p Erin They ve driven off two of the lions Oh They got the carcass Nice guys p p CH Mobbing has been the subject of study for decades because it s something of a mystery Hyenas behave instinctually and yet they find strength in numbers Enough hyenas together can overpower the stronger predators But how does this behavior evolve University of Texas at Austin computer science researchers Padmini Rajagopalan and Risto Miikkulainen studied this question p p Padmini Rajagopalan We can t study evolution in action in the real world the only way we can really do it is in simulation p p CH That s Rajagopalan She says evolution is just too slow to observe Plus you can t look back in time Instead you have to simulate how hyenas behaviors may have developed over the generations To accomplish this task Rajagopalan started out with 100 randomly generated learning algorithms they re sort of like stands in for those early hyenas brains And out of this first generation of 100 blank slate artificial hyenas Rajagopalan randomly selects ten of them assigning the task to mob the lion Now at least four of them will need to rush the lion simultaneously and if they run in too early they die If they come in after the lion is mobbed they get less food p p PR This way I test many different teams of 10 hyenas Once I ve done that I look at the population of hyenas and see which were closest to what I wanted them to do p p CH Many other teams of computerized hyenas from each generation are tested and run through these trials The hyenas that survive get to reproduce p p PR So what I mean by that is I mix up their little codes and get new hyenas that hopefully have some of the best characteristics p p CH The ones with higher fitness levels have more offspring This mimics how the behavior evolved in real life Hyenas that behave in ways that are beneficial then survive to mate and pass on their traits while those that behave in ways that hurt their chances of survival and mating are less likely to pass on their traits Repeating this selection testing and reproduction for 1 000 generations happens a lot faster on a computer than in real hyena lifetimes p p PR In the initial generations we saw other behaviors emerging There was this risk taking behavior where the hyena just went straight to the lion attacked the lion all by itself and died And there were these risk averse hyenas which stayed far away from the lion waiting for it to be driven away So they avoided death but they also didn t get much reward Slowly over the next few generations we saw that mobbing emerged as a kind of combination of these behaviors Both the risk averse and the risk taking p p CH So in other words mobbing arose out of two kinds of impulses the hyenas developed I don t want to die and I want the reward But then Rajagopalan saw something unexpected Those two extreme behaviors on each end of the spectrum rushing in and dying or waiting around the periphery those did not go away p p PR Those behaviors I mentioned that emerged early like the simple behaviors of attacking the lion by themselves or waiting around far away and never really participating in the mobbing event these behaviors still tended to stick around even though I evolved the hyenas for a very prolonged period So the mobbing behavior itself did emerge within the first ten generations but I kept the evolution going for 1 000 generations and still these other behaviors did not go away p p CH Why did they stick around Computer scientist Risto Miikkulainen who was Rajagopalan s advisor for the work asked the same question And he offered an explanation p p Risto Miikkulainen But why would they stay around You would think that hey now they have a successful mobbing that just takes over the whole population everybody does the same thing But you don t see that in biology I mean in all kinds of societies you see a persistent minority and we saw it here as well And that was a surprise but after the fact we can explain it Let s say that now there s a new species or new group of lions that are much much stronger for some reason So now it s really good to have hyenas that are less bold and the species survives and they develop a better strategy p p CH And similarly if lions became weaker being that fearless go it alone hyena might start to pay off with big rewards p p CH Now Miikkulainen explains that while these simulations are useful they won t entirely replace field work in the real world p p RM Computational simulations can always give you suggestions or insights or proposals on what to look at But the actual verification still has to be done in the discipline itself p p CH So thankfully biologists and computational scientists aren t in opposition Scientists can use technology in some constructive back and forth Biologists find something interesting in the field maybe in cells or primate behavior and computer scientists study it in theoretical space returning to the biologists a suggestion for what to look for in the field in real life For example in mobbing the UT computer scientists may ask field researchers if they observe those two hyena behaviors that stuck around in the simulations maybe if they see a hyena lurking far away and joining only after the mobbing has ended or if they see that brave hyena rushing in alone and risking its life In this way both groups need each other And there are plenty of fields this new kind of artificial intelligence computational evolution it s called could help Any field that involves complex problem solving can benefit from systems that evolve solutions to problems But Miikkulainen again makes it clear that the technology isn t meant to replace humans p p RM We are talking about machine creativity and machines coming up with surprises and solutions that humans won t think about But it s still a tool for humans It s an extension of their thinking p p CH This is Cason Hunwick reporting for Point of Discovery p p MA Thank you Cason Point of Discovery is a production of The University of Texas at Austin

to continually make robots more autonomous accurate robust and efficient in real world unstructured environments In the video above the robot referred to as the UT Campus Jackal navigated entirely

unexpected variations in the world including construction vehicular traffic and pedestrians stay on track and avoid going off course p p Biswas and his team have been working on topics related to long term outdoor navigation since 2015 when he worked as an assistant professor at The University of Massachusetts at Amherst The UT Campus Jackal is one of two platforms another being a larger robot called UT Campus Husky that the team uses to undertake research on perception and planning for long term autonomy This topic includes exploration of building perceptual models that can adapt to changing environments in real time allowing agents to identify perception failures independently and learning robot customization from human demonstrations p p A key to the robot s successful navigation was the localization method used At the basic level localization is how an autonomous agent knows where it is on the map in relation to other elements The AMRL used a href https www

as consisting of three classes of objects long term features corresponding to permanent mapped objects short term features corresponding to unmapped static objects and dynamic features corresponding to unmapped moving objects p p Imagine that the robot the AMRL deployed was sent out to navigate autonomously at three different times during UT Austin s academic calendar during freshman orientation during a Student Organization fair and during midterms In each scenario the robot is navigating the same distance and the same path It can expect that the building and statues that it passes to remain constant throughout each excursion Yet each time that it s deployed the robot experiences non static objects that can affect its journey lost freshmen tables packs of students making their way to class For robots that are deployed long term these potential changes need to be accounted for and the robot has to understand that the map it has of the terrain most likely won t remain static EnML is a localization method that helps autonomous agents account for the changes in their environment to help them navigate in a more natural way p p Biswas stated that the AMRL is excited to have the robot autonomously perform experiments during such deployments to improve its own perception algorithms in the wild noting that they are also interested in performing such tasks like mail and package

enough for a simulation model to just issue predictions A decision maker needs to know just how much those predictions can be trusted p p This is the objective of research in the critical area of predictive science which is about to take a major step forward at The University of Texas at Austin The Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences has been selected by the Department of Energy DOE to establish a Multidisciplinary Simulation Center with the mission to develop the next generation of exascale predictive simulation capabilities The center will support the research of dozens of scientists post docs and students and will foster close collaboration with researchers at Sandia National Laboratories Los Alamos National Laboratory and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory p p Bob Moser and George Biros from the Oden Institute and UT s Walker Department of Mechanical Engineering are leading the team of 18 faculty and senior researchers from six different departments which also includes a faculty member from Texas State University The new center is part of the Predictive Science Academic Alliance Program PSAAP and this is just the third time that PSAAP centers have been awarded by the DOE National Nuclear Security Administration NNSA since the program s inception in 2008 UT Austin was one of only four institutions nationwide to be selected to establish a Multidisciplinary Simulation Center p p This shows the power of collaborative research and how it allows us to take on grand challenge problems Moser said The challenging research agenda

have many applications from advanced manufacturing to destruction of hazardous waste Currently an ICP torch experimental facility developed at UT Austin is being used to test materials for use on future spacecraft p p Simulating the torch however is a means to a greater end It is a way to achieve the primary objective of the center advancing predictive science capabilities Moser said p p Oden Institute researchers will develop capabilities for predictive modeling and simulation of the plasma torch while researchers from the Cockrell School of Engineering will conduct physical experiments A key goal of the project is to combine the power of simulation and experiment to improve predictive capability p p The center s capacity to advance predictive science is enabled by the supercomputing power and expertise available at the Texas Advanced Computing Center TACC Using systems such as TACC s Frontera the world s most powerful academic supercomputer in tandem with the DOE s high performance computing systems the new predictive science center will also advance exascale computing the next generation of the most powerful high performance computing systems p p TACC s exceptionally powerful computing resources will enable us to design and test novel exascale algorithms Biros said We anticipate discoveries in computer science HPC and computational science that could

perseverance the Texas Computer Science TXCS alumna who graduated from the university in 1998 earned her degree at a time where there were probably four Black people in the whole computer science department With over 20 years of experience in the technology industry Jones has witnessed massive shifts in how the world grapples with diversity new technologies and how businesses operate p p Graduating from The University of Texas at Austin for Jones was a game changer After graduating she started working at a startup in Austin called 360Commerce As a Black woman who was the first in her family to graduate from college entering the technology field in the early aughts meant diving head first into a world I didn t know p p In her early career Jones was always the only woman most of the time And all of the time the only Black woman on the tech team Her experience made her question why there weren t more Black women programmers and how to change this lack of diversity In 2004 when Oracle acquired 360Commerce Jones saw an opportunity to create the type of diverse work environment that she dreamed of Rather than join another company and show management the value of a diverse workforce Jones decided to make her own company with diversity built into its DNA p p Her company called Lillii RNB stands for Let s imagine life with ladies in IT and is an IT consultancy that works with Fortune 500 companies and government agencies From the beginning her goal was to have a team that looks like the world This purposeful diversity not only allowed more people into the tech industry but it played a strategic role When you have that many ideas with a diverse group of people it makes us very valuable to our clients said Jones p p To me if you want to diversify your teams you can And that was my mission and now we have a very diverse team so it definitely can be done And those developers are out there you have to have the desire to find them she said p p Jones found that the biggest struggle while starting her business was raising capital to get my business off the ground After failing to get enough capital Jones saved 250 000 of her own money to finance her business From there she was able to start her business and hire employees whom she had to train in the relatively obscure technology p p Now Lillii RNB is off the ground and doing well They re doing so well that they are working on a technology solution with the potential to help cities open up as many are under strict guidelines during COVID 19 She participated in the Ascend 2020 Cohort III and while working with three other small business owners proposed a method that would allow cities to safely open p p Her cohort designed a method of installing Internet of Things IoT devices throughout different buildings being cleaned As the cleaning is complete the devices update the dashboard to show where and when each building was sanitized They proposed the idea to the city of Atlanta and are now working on deploying the technology p p I was thinking about accountability she said Jones believed that cities that were equipped with data would make their reopening efforts both more secure and justifiable It s one thing to open a city during a pandemic it s another to actually track with metrics and dashboards the methods that prove that a city is doing it safely We can tell city officials This is how we re reopening this is how we re cleaning this is how we re making sure that buildings are getting clean and are safe p p Jones is excited to see where her career and company take her Her story is an example of the power being courageous following your passion and having the willingness to be the lone voice in the room championing for change In her words It starts with us p div div div

been successful What are the most important selection criteria The essential aspect of the application is the individual applicant s academic qualification Please refer to the relevant programme information for more details on the selection criteria Can I re apply after being rejected It is possible to re apply The new application should however differ significantly from the original rejected application Generally it makes sense to re apply after developing one s academic profile e g after academical publications have been accepted by internationally reviewed journals and publishing houses Our experience shows that applicants should wait about two years before re applying Submitting a new application that differs little or not at all from the rejected original may result in a formal

Science 2012 Shafi Goldwasser has had tremendous impact on the development of cryptography and complexity theory Starting with her thesis on semantic security she laid the foundations of the theory of cryptography She created rigorous definitions and constructions of well known primitives such as encryption schemes both public and private key versions and digital signatures and of new ones that she introduced such as zero knowledge interactive proof systems invented with Micali and Rackoff Continuing her work on interactive proofs which allow a probabilistic polynomial time algorithm to verify mathematical proofs via interaction with a powerful prover Shafi and her co authors extended the notion of interactive proofs to two prover systems The original motivation was cryptographic but they turned out to be of great significance in complexity theory paving the way to the equivalent formulation of PCP probabilistically checkable proofs The expressive power of two prover systems is huge non deterministic exponential time furthermore Shafi and her co authors showed the connection between a scaled down variant of these systems and the hardness of approximation results for NP hard problems which led to the PCP theorem On the algorithmic front a problem of great significance is that of recognizing and generating prime numbers Shafi and Kilian designed efficient probabilistic

class of sub linear algorithms to test properties in dense graphs Read More Russell Impagliazzo Ph D University of California San Diego Theoretical Computer Science 2012 Russell Impagliazzo has made

sequences of bits for which it is computationally hard to predict the next bit with accuracy much better than random guessing if and only if there are easy to compute functions that are hard to invert on the average Russell also showed that there are worlds in which certain cryptographic primitives are strictly inequivalent For example there are worlds where one way functions exist but public key encryption is not possible One of Russell s major contributions in complexity theory is the exponential time hypothesis and its implications The hypothesis states that there are problems where it is hard to speed up the brute force solution even by a small amount Russell helped establish the first complete problem for this class In joint work with Avi Wigderson Russell showed that if there are problems in exponential time that require exponential sized circuits to solve then any efficient algorithm that uses randomization has an equivalent efficient one that does not Read More Jon Kleinberg

distinct research communities theoretical computer science applied mathematics and operations research His work on smoothed analysis of linear programming provides mathematical justification for why the simplex method to solve problems works well in practice even though worst case analysis shows that there are instances in which it takes exponential time A small random perturbation converts any linear programming instance into one that with high probability is solved efficiently by the simplex algorithm Similar perturbation results hold for many other problems and provide an alternative to worst case analysis which may be too pessimistic His codes based on expander graphs achieve near optimal rate and nearly linear time encoding and decoding algorithms In joint work with Teng Spielman

Linkedin Github Resume Intro Work Projects Contact About Me Intro I am a junior at the University of Texas at Austin pursuing a B S in Computer Science with an expected graduation date of Spring 2021 I am actively seeking an internship for Summer 2020 My interests include cybersecurity incorporating the natural sciences with computer science along with mobile and web development My goal is to foster advancements and discoveries in technology that can be applied to multiple fields of study and ultimately improve the lives of many people in a variety of different ways I am most confident working with R C C and Java but am willing and eager to learn new technologies Check out some of my past work experience and projects Work Experience Incyte Corporation Summer 2019 This was such a fun and fulfilling learning experience for me It was my first peek into the world of biotech and pharmaceuticals I got to work in the Translational Sciences department alongside many talented statisticians computational biologists and more I also got to shadow some department meetings and attend sessions educating interns about the company and the life cycle of developing a drug The brunt of my work involved developing a user friendly web application in R R Shiny web dev package for R that would allow scientists to query Project Achilles data At the end of the 8 weeks I gave a 10 minute presentation summarizing what I ve learned that summer and showcasing my project It was definitely rewarding Projects CRISPR A user friendly interface for biologists to query the CRISPR Cas9 and Project Achilles database and interact directly with the CRISPR Cas9 dropout screens The dropout screens systematically destroy genes within a group of cancer cells to analyze the impact of destroying a given gene on cancer cell growth Gave biologists the ability to compare two different groups of cancer cell lines filtered on specific criteria within the application Cell line groups can be picked based on shared mutations high and low expression level or shared fusions Comparisons output data in form of table displaying means of each group p value and adjusted p value and a colorful plot of the cell line groups dependencies against a user chosen gene colored by tissue type Huffman Coding Program that compresses files hf and decompresses unhf using the Huffman algorithm Calculates the number of bits saved upon compression Uses trees recursion queues and arrays amongst others QEMU Audio Worked with 3 other classmates to implement audio through the PC Speaker ports in an operating system our CS 439 professor created capable of playing songs by coding notes at certain frequencies Done via the QEMU emulator and VirtualBox Gave 2 PowerPoint presentations in the span of 2 weeks an initial presentation to discuss our research and a final presentation to demonstrate the end project Evil Hangman Evil version of Hangman game in which the computer narrows the word pool based on the user s guesses This makes it extremely hard for the human player to win over the computer Uses maps arrays and iterators amongst others Contact The easiest and most convienient way to
