to use CPT once you ve been enrolled for two long semesters and are in valid F 1 status However if your program requires immediate participation in an internship or you are transferring to UT Austin at the same degree level you may be eligible for CPT during your first semester at UT Austin Please reach out to us at hotline austin utexas edu to inquire about your eligibility There is no class available for me to use with CPT and employment is not required for my degree If you cannot receive credit for the work you do then you are not eligible for CPT You would need to consider applying for pre completion Optional Practical Training in order to accept a paid internship opportunity Schedule an appointment to meet with an international student advisor to discuss this option Do I need to request CPT for an unpaid internship Generally no You must be sure that you do not receive any type of compensation even non monetary compensation for the work that you do For example you cannot receive free room and board in exchange for employment without CPT authorization The work must also be a position that is regularly uncompensated We recommend that you request a letter from the internship provider that confirms that you are not receiving any type of compensation and that the work is a regularly unpaid position You do not need to show the letter to ISSS but you should keep it

http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/feynman.html ##### Feynman s Talk There s Plenty of Room at the Bottom An Invitation to Enter a New Field of Physics by Richard P Feynman This transcript of the classic talk that Richard Feynman gave on December 29th 1959 at the annual meeting of the American Physical Society at the California Institute of Technology Caltech was first published in Caltech Engineering and Science Volume 23 5 February 1960 pp 22 36 It has been made available on the web at http www zyvex com nanotech feynman html with their kind permission The scanned original is available The Wikipedia entry on Feynman s talk Information on the Feynman Prizes Search YouTube for Richard Feynman For an account of the talk and how people reacted to it see chapter 4 of Nano by Ed Regis Little Brown 1995 An excellent technical introduction to nanotechnology is Nanosystems molecular machinery manufacturing and computation by K Eric Drexler Wiley 1992 The Feynman Lectures on Physics are available online I imagine experimental physicists must often look with envy at men like Kamerlingh Onnes who discovered a field like low temperature which seems to be bottomless and in which one can go down and down Such a man is then a leader and has some temporary monopoly in a scientific adventure Percy Bridgman in designing a way to obtain higher pressures opened up another new field and was able to move into it and to lead us all along The development of ever higher vacuum was a continuing development of the same kind I would like to describe a field in which little has been done but in which an enormous amount can be done in principle This field is not quite the same as the others in that it will not tell us much of fundamental physics in the sense of What are the strange particles but it is more like solid state physics in the sense that it might tell us much of great interest about the strange phenomena that occur in complex situations Furthermore a point that is most important is that it would have an enormous number of technical applications What I want to talk about is the problem of manipulating and controlling things on a small scale As soon as I mention this people tell me about miniaturization and how far it has progressed today They tell me about electric motors that are the size of the nail on your small finger And there is a device on the market they tell me by which you can write the Lord s Prayer on the head of a pin But that s nothing that s the most primitive halting step in the direction I intend to discuss It is a staggeringly small world that is below In the year 2000 when they look back at this age they will wonder why it was not until the year 1960 that anybody began seriously to move in this direction Why cannot we write the entire 24 volumes of the Encyclopaedia Brittanica on the head of a pin Let s see what would be involved The head of a pin is a sixteenth of an inch across If you magnify it by 25 000 diameters the area of the head of the pin is then equal to the area of all the pages of the Encyclopaedia Brittanica Therefore all it is necessary to do is to reduce in size all the writing in the Encyclopaedia by 25 000 times Is that possible The resolving power of the eye is about 1 120 of an inch that is roughly the diameter of one of the little dots on the fine half tone reproductions in the Encyclopaedia This when you demagnify it by 25 000 times is still 80 angstroms in diameter 32 atoms across in an ordinary metal In other words one of those dots still would contain in its area 1 000 atoms So each dot can easily be adjusted in size as required by the photoengraving and there is no question that there is enough room on the head of a pin to put all of the Encyclopaedia Brittanica Furthermore it can be read if it is so written Let s imagine that it is written in raised letters of metal that is where the black is in the Encyclopedia we have raised letters of metal that are actually 1 25 000 of their ordinary size How would we read it If we had something written in such a way we could read it using techniques in common use today They will undoubtedly find a better way when we do actually have it written but to make my point conservatively I shall just take techniques we know today We would press the metal into a plastic material and make a mold of it then peel the plastic off very carefully evaporate silica into the plastic to get a very thin film then shadow it by evaporating gold at an angle against the silica so that all the little letters will appear clearly dissolve the plastic away from the silica film and then look through it with an electron microscope There is no question that if the thing were reduced by 25 000 times in the form of raised letters on the pin it would be easy for us to read it today Furthermore there is no question that we would find it easy to make copies of the master we would just need to press the same metal plate again into plastic and we would have another copy How do we write small The next question is How do we write it We have no standard technique to do this now But let me argue that it is not as difficult as it first appears to be We can reverse the lenses of the electron microscope in order to demagnify as well as magnify A source of ions sent through the microscope lenses in reverse could be focused to a very small spot We could write with that spot like we write in a TV cathode ray oscilloscope by going across in lines and having an adjustment which determines the amount of material which is going to be deposited as we scan in lines This method might be very slow because of space charge limitations There will be more rapid methods We could first make perhaps by some photo process a screen which has holes in it in the form of the letters Then we would strike an arc behind the holes and draw metallic ions through the holes then we could again use our system of lenses and make a small image in the form of ions which would deposit the metal on the pin A simpler way might be this though I am not sure it would work We take light and through an optical microscope running backwards we focus it onto a very small photoelectric screen Then electrons come away from the screen where the light is shining These electrons are focused down in size by the electron microscope lenses to impinge directly upon the surface of the metal Will such a beam etch away the metal if it is run long enough I don t know If it doesn t work for a metal surface it must be possible to find some surface with which to coat the original pin so that where the electrons bombard a change is made which we could recognize later There is no intensity problem in these devices not what you are used to in magnification where you have to take a few electrons and spread them over a bigger and bigger screen it is just the opposite The light which we get from a page is concentrated onto a very small area so it is very intense The few electrons which come from the photoelectric screen are demagnified down to a very tiny area so that again they are very intense I don t know why this hasn t been done yet That s the Encyclopaedia Brittanica on the head of a pin but let s consider all the books in the world The Library of Congress has approximately 9 million volumes the British Museum Library has 5 million volumes there are also 5 million volumes in the National Library in France Undoubtedly there are duplications so let us say that there are some 24 million volumes of interest in the world What would happen if I print all this down at the scale we have been discussing How much space would it take It would take of course the area of about a million pinheads because instead of there being just the 24 volumes of the Encyclopaedia there are 24 million volumes The million pinheads can be put in a square of a thousand pins on a side or an area of about 3 square yards That is to say the silica replica with the paper thin backing of plastic with which we have made the copies with all this information is on an area of approximately the size of 35 pages of the Encyclopaedia That is about half as many pages as there are in this magazine All of the information which all of mankind has ever recorded in books can be carried around in a pamphlet in your hand and not written in code but as a simple reproduction of the original pictures engravings and everything else on a small scale without loss of resolution What would our librarian at Caltech say as she runs all over from one building to another if I tell her that ten years from now all of the information that she is struggling to keep track of 120 000 volumes stacked from the floor to the ceiling drawers full of cards storage rooms full of the older books can be kept on just one library card When the University of Brazil for example finds that their library is burned we can send them a copy of every book in our library by striking off a copy from the master plate in a few hours and mailing it in an envelope no bigger or heavier than any other ordinary air mail letter Now the name of this talk is There is Plenty of Room at the Bottom not just There is Room at the Bottom What I have demonstrated is that there is room that you can decrease the size of things in a practical way I now want to show that there is plenty of room I will not now discuss how we are going to do it but only what is possible in principle in other words what is possible according to the laws of physics I am not inventing anti gravity which is possible someday only if the laws are not what we think I am telling you what could be done if the laws are what we think we are not doing it simply because we haven t yet gotten around to it Information on a small scale Suppose that instead of trying to reproduce the pictures and all the information directly in its present form we write only the information content in a code of dots and dashes or something like that to represent the various letters Each letter represents six or seven bits of information that is you need only about six or seven dots or dashes for each letter Now instead of writing everything as I did before on the surface of the head of a pin I am going to use the interior of the material as well Let us represent a dot by a small spot of one metal the next dash by an adjacent spot of another metal and so on Suppose to be conservative that a bit of information is going to require a little cube of atoms 5 x 5 x 5 that is 125 atoms Perhaps we need a hundred and some odd atoms to make sure that the information is not lost through diffusion or through some other process I have estimated how many letters there are in the Encyclopaedia and I have assumed that each of my 24 million books is as big as an Encyclopaedia volume and have calculated then how many bits of information there are 1015 For each bit I allow 100 atoms And it turns out that all of the information that man has carefully accumulated in all the books in the world can be written in this form in a cube of material one two hundredth of an inch wide which is the barest piece of dust that can be made out by the human eye So there is plenty of room at the bottom Don t tell me about microfilm This fact that enormous amounts of information can be carried in an exceedingly small space is of course well known to the biologists and resolves the mystery which existed before we understood all this clearly of how it could be that in the tiniest cell all of the information for the organization of a complex creature such as ourselves can be stored All this information whether we have brown eyes or whether we think at all or that in the embryo the jawbone should first develop with a little hole in the side so that later a nerve can grow through it all this information is contained in a very tiny fraction of the cell in the form of long chain DNA molecules in which approximately 50 atoms are used for one bit of information about the cell Better electron microscopes If I have written in a code with 5 x 5 x 5 atoms to a bit the question is How could I read it today The electron microscope is not quite good enough with the greatest care and effort it can only resolve about 10 angstroms I would like to try and impress upon you while I am talking about all of these things on a small scale the importance of improving the electron microscope by a hundred times It is not impossible it is not against the laws of diffraction of the electron The wave length of the electron in such a microscope is only 1 20 of an angstrom So it should be possible to see the individual atoms What good would it be to see individual atoms distinctly We have friends in other fields in biology for instance We physicists often look at them and say You know the reason you fellows are making so little progress Actually I don t know any field where they are making more rapid progress than they are in biology today You should use more mathematics like we do They could answer us but they re polite so I ll answer for them What you should do in order for us to make more rapid progress is to make the electron microscope 100 times better What are the most central and fundamental problems of biology today They are questions like What is the sequence of bases in the DNA What happens when you have a mutation How is the base order in the DNA connected to the order of amino acids in the protein What is the structure of the RNA is it single chain or double chain and how is it related in its order of bases to the DNA What is the organization of the microsomes How are proteins synthesized Where does the RNA go How does it sit Where do the proteins sit Where do the amino acids go in In photosynthesis where is the chlorophyll how is it arranged where are the carotenoids involved in this thing What is the system of the conversion of light into chemical energy It is very easy to answer many of these fundamental biological questions you just look at the thing You will see the order of bases in the chain you will see the structure of the microsome Unfortunately the present microscope sees at a scale which is just a bit too crude Make the microscope one hundred times more powerful and many problems of biology would be made very much easier I exaggerate of course but the biologists would surely be very thankful to you and they would prefer that to the criticism that they should use more mathematics The theory of chemical processes today is based on theoretical physics In this sense physics supplies the foundation of chemistry But chemistry also has analysis If you have a strange substance and you want to know what it is you go through a long and complicated process of chemical analysis You can analyze almost anything today so I am a little late with my idea But if the physicists wanted to they could also dig under the chemists in the problem of chemical analysis It would be very easy to make an analysis of any complicated chemical substance all one would have to do would be to look at it and see where the atoms are The only trouble is that the electron microscope is one hundred times too poor Later I would like to ask the question Can the physicists do something about the third problem of chemistry namely synthesis Is there a physical way to synthesize any chemical substance The reason the electron microscope is so poor is that the f value of the lenses is only 1 part to 1 000 you don t have a big enough numerical aperture And I know that there are theorems which prove that it is impossible with axially symmetrical stationary field lenses to produce an f value any bigger than so and so and therefore the resolving power at the present time is at its theoretical maximum But in every theorem there are assumptions Why must the field be axially symmetrical Why must the field be stationary Can t we have pulsed electron beams in fields moving up along with the electrons Must the field be symmetrical I put this out as a challenge Is there no way to make the electron microscope more powerful The marvelous biological system The biological example of writing information on a small scale has inspired me to think of something that should be possible Biology is not simply writing information it is doing something about it A biological system can be exceedingly small Many of the cells are very tiny but they are very active they manufacture various substances they walk around they wiggle and they do all kinds of marvelous things all on a very small scale Also they store information Consider the possibility that we too can make a thing very small which does what we want that we can manufacture an object that maneuvers at that level There may even be an economic point to this business of making things very small Let me remind you of some of the problems of computing machines In computers we have to store an enormous amount of information The kind of writing that I was mentioning before in which I had everything down as a distribution of metal is permanent Much more interesting to a computer is a way of writing erasing and writing something else This is usually because we don t want to waste the material on which we have just written Yet if we could write it in a very small space it wouldn t make any difference it could just be thrown away after it was read It doesn t cost very much for the material Miniaturizing the computer I don t know how to do this on a small scale in a practical way but I do know that computing machines are very large they fill rooms Why can t we make them very small make them of little wires little elements and by little I mean little For instance the wires should be 10 or 100 atoms in diameter and the circuits should be a few thousand angstroms across Everybody who has analyzed the logical theory of computers has come to the conclusion that the possibilities of computers are very interesting if they could be made to be more complicated by several orders of magnitude If they had millions of times as many elements they could make judgments They would have time to calculate what is the best way to make the calculation that they are about to make They could select the method of analysis which from their experience is better than the one that we would give to them And in many other ways they would have new qualitative features If I look at your face I immediately recognize that I have seen it before Actually my friends will say I have chosen an unfortunate example here for the subject of this illustration At least I recognize that it is a man and not an apple Yet there is no machine which with that speed can take a picture of a face and say even that it is a man and much less that it is the same man that you showed it before unless it is exactly the same picture If the face is changed if I am closer to the face if I am further from the face if the light changes I recognize it anyway Now this little computer I carry in my head is easily able to do that The computers that we build are not able to do that The number of elements in this bone box of mine are enormously greater than the number of elements in our wonderful computers But our mechanical computers are too big the elements in this box are microscopic I want to make some that are sub microscopic If we wanted to make a computer that had all these marvelous extra qualitative abilities we would have to make it perhaps the size of the Pentagon This has several disadvantages First it requires too much material there may not be enough germanium in the world for all the transistors which would have to be put into this enormous thing There is also the problem of heat generation and power consumption TVA would be needed to run the computer But an even more practical difficulty is that the computer would be limited to a certain speed Because of its large size there is finite time required to get the information from one place to another The information cannot go any faster than the speed of light so ultimately when our computers get faster and faster and more and more elaborate we will have to make them smaller and smaller But there is plenty of room to make them smaller There is nothing that I can see in the physical laws that says the computer elements cannot be made enormously smaller than they are now In fact there may be certain advantages Miniaturization by evaporation How can we make such a device What kind of manufacturing processes would we use One possibility we might consider since we have talked about writing by putting atoms down in a certain arrangement would be to evaporate the material then evaporate the insulator next to it Then for the next layer evaporate another position of a wire another insulator and so on So you simply evaporate until you have a block of stuff which has the elements coils and condensers transistors and so on of exceedingly fine dimensions But I would like to discuss just for amusement that there are other possibilities Why can t we manufacture these small computers somewhat like we manufacture the big ones Why can t we drill holes cut things solder things stamp things out mold different shapes all at an infinitesimal level What are the limitations as to how small a thing has to be before you can no longer mold it How many times when you are working on something frustratingly tiny like your wife s wrist watch have you said to yourself If I could only train an ant to do this What I would like to suggest is the possibility of training an ant to train a mite to do this What are the possibilities of small but movable machines They may or may not be useful but they surely would be fun to make Consider any machine for example an automobile and ask about the problems of making an infinitesimal machine like it Suppose in the particular design of the automobile we need a certain precision of the parts we need an accuracy let s suppose of 4 10 000 of an inch If things are more inaccurate than that in the shape of the cylinder and so on it isn t going to work very well If I make the thing too small I have to worry about the size of the atoms I can t make a circle out of balls so to speak if the circle is too small So if I make the error corresponding to 4 10 000 of an inch correspond to an error of 10 atoms it turns out that I can reduce the dimensions of an automobile 4 000 times approximately so that it is 1 mm across Obviously if you redesign the car so that it would work with a much larger tolerance which is not at all impossible then you could make a much smaller device It is interesting to consider what the problems are in such small machines Firstly with parts stressed to the same degree the forces go as the area you are reducing so that things like weight and inertia are of relatively no importance The strength of material in other words is very much greater in proportion The stresses and expansion of the flywheel from centrifugal force for example would be the same proportion only if the rotational speed is increased in the same proportion as we decrease the size On the other hand the metals that we use have a grain structure and this would be very annoying at small scale because the material is not homogeneous Plastics and glass and things of this amorphous nature are very much more homogeneous and so we would have to make our machines out of such materials There are problems associated with the electrical part of the system with the copper wires and the magnetic parts The magnetic properties on a very small scale are not the same as on a large scale there is the domain problem involved A big magnet made of millions of domains can only be made on a small scale with one domain The electrical equipment won t simply be scaled down it has to be redesigned But I can see no reason why it can t be redesigned to work again Problems of lubrication Lubrication involves some interesting points The effective viscosity of oil would be higher and higher in proportion as we went down and if we increase the speed as much as we can If we don t increase the speed so much and change from oil to kerosene or some other fluid the problem is not so bad But actually we may not have to lubricate at all We have a lot of extra force Let the bearings run dry they won t run hot because the heat escapes away from such a small device very very rapidly This rapid heat loss would prevent the gasoline from exploding so an internal combustion engine is impossible Other chemical reactions liberating energy when cold can be used Probably an external supply of electrical power would be most convenient for such small machines What would be the utility of such machines Who knows Of course a small automobile would only be useful for the mites to drive around in and I suppose our Christian interests don t go that far However we did note the possibility of the manufacture of small elements for computers in completely automatic factories containing lathes and other machine tools at the very small level The small lathe would not have to be exactly like our big lathe I leave to your imagination the improvement of the design to take full advantage of the properties of things on a small scale and in such a way that the fully automatic aspect would be easiest to manage A friend of mine Albert R Hibbs suggests a very interesting possibility for relatively small machines He says that although it is a very wild idea it would be interesting in surgery if you could swallow the surgeon You put the mechanical surgeon inside the blood vessel and it goes into the heart and looks around Of course the information has to be fed out It finds out which valve is the faulty one and takes a little knife and slices it out Other small machines might be permanently incorporated in the body to assist some inadequately functioning organ Now comes the interesting question How do we make such a tiny mechanism I leave that to you However let me suggest one weird possibility You know in the atomic energy plants they have materials and machines that they can t handle directly because they have become radioactive To unscrew nuts and put on bolts and so on they have a set of master and slave hands so that by operating a set of levers here you control the hands there and can turn them this way and that so you can handle things quite nicely Most of these devices are actually made rather simply in that there is a particular cable like a marionette string that goes directly from the controls to the hands But of course things also have been made using servo motors so that the connection between the one thing and the other is electrical rather than mechanical When you turn the levers they turn a servo motor and it changes the electrical currents in the wires which repositions a motor at the other end Now I want to build much the same device a master slave system which operates electrically But I want the slaves to be made especially carefully by modern large scale machinists so that they are one fourth the scale of the hands that you ordinarily maneuver So you have a scheme by which you can do things at one quarter scale anyway the little servo motors with little hands play with little nuts and bolts they drill little holes they are four times smaller Aha So I manufacture a quarter size lathe I manufacture quarter size tools and I make at the one quarter scale still another set of hands again relatively one quarter size This is one sixteenth size from my point of view And after I finish doing this I wire directly from my large scale system through transformers perhaps to the one sixteenth size servo motors Thus I can now manipulate the one sixteenth size hands Well you get the principle from there on It is rather a difficult program but it is a possibility You might say that one can go much farther in one step than from one to four Of course this has all to be designed very carefully and it is not necessary simply to make it like hands If you thought of it very carefully you could probably arrive at a much better system for doing such things If you work through a pantograph even today you can get much more than a factor of four in even one step But you can t work directly through a pantograph which makes a smaller pantograph which then makes a smaller pantograph because of the looseness of the holes and the irregularities of construction The end of the pantograph wiggles with a relatively greater irregularity than the irregularity with which you move your hands In going down this scale I would find the end of the pantograph on the end of the pantograph on the end of the pantograph shaking so badly that it wasn t doing anything sensible at all At each stage it is necessary to improve the precision of the apparatus If for instance having made a small lathe with a pantograph we find its lead screw irregular more irregular than the large scale one we could lap the lead screw against breakable nuts that you can reverse in the usual way back and forth until this lead screw is at its scale as accurate as our original lead screws at our scale We can make flats by rubbing unflat surfaces in triplicates together in three pairs and the flats then become flatter than the thing you started with Thus it is not impossible to improve precision on a small scale by the correct operations So when we build this stuff it is necessary at each step to improve the accuracy of the equipment by working for awhile down there making accurate lead screws Johansen blocks and all the other materials which we use in accurate machine work at the higher level We have to stop at each level and manufacture all the stuff to go to the next level a very long and very difficult program Perhaps you can figure a better way than that to get down to small scale more rapidly Yet after all this you have just got one little baby lathe four thousand times smaller than usual But we were thinking of making an enormous computer which we were going to build by drilling holes on this lathe to make little washers for the computer How many washers can you manufacture on this one lathe A hundred tiny hands When I make my first set of slave hands at one fourth scale I am going to make ten sets I make ten sets of hands and I wire them to my original levers so they each do exactly the same thing at the same time in parallel Now when I am making my new devices one quarter again as small I let each one manufacture ten copies so that I would have a hundred hands at the 1 16th size Where am I going to put the million lathes that I am going to have Why there is nothing to it the volume is much less than that of even one full scale lathe For instance if I made a billion little lathes each 1 4000 of the scale of a regular lathe there are plenty of materials and space available because in the billion little ones there is less than 2 percent of the materials in one big lathe It doesn t cost anything for materials you see So I want to build a billion tiny factories models of each other which are manufacturing simultaneously drilling holes stamping parts and so on As we go down in size there are a number of interesting problems that arise All things do not simply scale down in proportion There is the problem that materials stick together by the molecular Van der Waals attractions It would be like this After you have made a part and you unscrew the nut from a bolt it isn t going to fall down because the gravity isn t appreciable it would even be hard to get it off the bolt It would be like those old movies of a man with his hands full of molasses trying to get rid of a glass of water There will be several problems of this nature that we will have to be ready to design for Rearranging the atoms But I am not afraid to consider the final question as to whether ultimately in the great future we can arrange the atoms the way we want the very atoms all the way down What would happen if we could arrange the atoms one by one the way we want them within reason of course you can t put them so that they are chemically unstable for example Up to now we have been content to dig in the ground to find minerals We heat them and we do things on a large scale with them and we hope to get a pure substance with just so much impurity and so on But we must always accept some atomic arrangement that nature gives us We haven t got anything say with a checkerboard arrangement with the impurity atoms exactly arranged 1 000 angstroms apart or in some other particular pattern What could we do with layered structures with just the right layers What would the properties of materials be if we could really arrange the atoms the way we want them They would be very interesting to investigate theoretically I can t see exactly what would happen but I can hardly doubt that when we have some control of the arrangement of things on a small scale we will get an enormously greater range of possible properties that substances can have and of different things that we can do Consider for example a piece of material in which we make little coils and condensers or their solid state analogs 1 000 or 10 000 angstroms in a circuit one right next to the other over a large area with little antennas sticking out at the other end a whole series of circuits Is it possible for example to emit light from a whole set of antennas like we emit radio waves from an organized set of antennas to beam the radio programs to Europe The same thing would be to beam the light out in a definite direction with very high intensity Perhaps such a beam is not very useful technically or economically I have thought about some of the problems of building electric circuits on a small scale and the problem of resistance is serious If you build a corresponding circuit on a small scale its natural frequency goes up since the wave length goes down as the scale but the skin depth only decreases with the square root of the scale ratio and so resistive problems are of increasing difficulty Possibly we can beat resistance through the use of superconductivity if the frequency is not too high or by other tricks Atoms in a small world When we get to the very very small world say circuits of seven atoms we have a lot of new things that would happen that represent completely new opportunities for design Atoms on a small scale behave like nothing on a large scale for they satisfy the laws of quantum mechanics So as we go down and fiddle around with the atoms down there we are working with different laws and we can expect to do different things We can manufacture in different ways We can use not just circuits but some system involving the quantized energy levels or the interactions of quantized spins etc Another thing we will notice is that if we go down far enough all of our devices can be mass produced so that they are absolutely perfect copies of one another We cannot build two large machines so that the dimensions are exactly the same But if your machine is only 100 atoms high you only have to get it correct to one half of one percent to make sure the other machine is exactly the same size namely 100 atoms high At the atomic level we have new kinds of forces and new kinds of possibilities new kinds of effects The problems of manufacture and reproduction of materials will be quite different I am as I said inspired by the biological phenomena in which chemical forces are used in a repetitious fashion to produce all kinds of weird effects one of which is the author The principles of physics as far as I can see do not speak against the possibility of maneuvering things atom by atom It is not an attempt to violate any laws it is something in principle that can be done but in practice it has not been done because we are too big Ultimately we can do chemical synthesis A chemist comes to us and says Look I want a molecule that has the atoms arranged thus and so make me that molecule The chemist does a mysterious thing when he wants to make a molecule He sees that it has got that ring so he mixes this and that and he shakes it and he fiddles around And at the end of a difficult process he usually does succeed in synthesizing what he wants By the time I get my devices working so that we can do it by physics he will have figured out how to synthesize absolutely anything so that this will really be useless But it is interesting that it would be in principle possible I think for a physicist to synthesize any chemical substance that the chemist writes down Give the orders and the physicist synthesizes it How Put the atoms down where the chemist says and so you make the substance The problems of chemistry and biology can be greatly helped if our ability to see what we are doing and to do things on an atomic level is ultimately developed a development which I think cannot be avoided Now you might say Who should do this and why should they do it Well I pointed out a few of the economic applications but I know that the reason that you would do it might be just for fun But have some fun Let s have a competition between laboratories Let one laboratory make a tiny motor which it sends to another lab which sends it back with a thing that fits inside the shaft of the first motor High school competition Just for the fun of it and in order to get kids interested in this field I would propose that someone who has some contact with the high schools think of making some kind of high school competition After all we haven t even started in this field and even the kids can write smaller than has ever been written before They could have competition in high schools The Los Angeles high school could send a pin to the Venice high school on which it says How s this They get the pin back and in the dot of the i it says Not so hot Perhaps this doesn t excite you to do it and only economics will do so Then I want to do something but I can t do it at the present moment because I haven t prepared the ground It is my intention to offer a prize of 1 000 to the first guy who can take the information on the page of a book and put it on an area 1 25 000 smaller in linear scale in such manner that it can be read by an electron microscope And I want to offer another prize if I can figure out how to phrase it so that I don t get into a mess of arguments about definitions of another 1 000 to the first guy who makes an operating electric motor a rotating electric motor which can be controlled from the outside and not counting the lead in wires is only 1 64 inch cube I do not expect that such prizes will have to wait very long for claimants This page is part of the nanotechnology web site

wastes others time Procrastination Procrastination is the thief of time Edward Young Night Thoughts 1742 Balancing Act Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion Parkinson s Law Cyril Parkinson 1957 Avoiding Procrastination doing things at the last minute is much more expensive than just before the last minute deadlines are really important establish them yourself Comfort

the Character Ethic by Stephen R Covey Simon and Schuster 1989 1 BE PROACTIVE Between stimulus and response in human beings lies the power to choose Productivity then means that we are solely responsible for what happens in our lives No fair blaming anyone or anything else 2 BEGIN WITH THE END IN MIND Imagine your funeral and listen to what you would like the eulogists to say about you This should reveal exactly what matters most to you in your life Use this frame of reference to make all your day to day decisions so that you are working toward your most meaningful life goals 3 PUT FIRST THINGS FIRST To manage our lives effectively we must keep our mission in mind understand what s important as well as urgent and maintain a balance between what we produce each day and our ability to produce in the future Think of the former as putting out fires and the latter as personal development 4 THINK WIN WIN Agreements or solutions among people can be mutually beneficial if all parties cooperate and begin with a belief in the third alternative a better way that hasn t been thought of yet 5 SEEK FIRST TO BE UNDERSTANDING THEN TO BE UNDERSTOOD Most people don t listen Not really They listen long enough to devise a solution to the speaker s problem or a rejoinder to what s being said Then they dive into the conversation You ll be more effective in your relationships with people if you sincerely try to understand them fully before you try to make them understand your point of view 6 SYNERGIZE Just what it sounds like The whole is greater than the sum of its parts In practice this means you must use creative cooperation in social interactions Value differences because it is often the clash between them that leads to creative solutions 7 SHARPEN THE SAW This is the habit of self renewal which has four elements The first is mental which includes reading visualizing planning and writing The second is spiritual which means value clarification and commitment study and meditation Third is social emotional which includes service empathy synergy and intrinsic security Finally the physical element includes exercise nutrition and stress management Randy Pausch

http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mckinley/notes/reviewing.html ##### Notes on Constructive and Positive Reviewing Notes on Constructive and Positive Reviewing May 2005 Mark Hill University of Wisconsin Madison Kathryn S McKinley The University of Texas at Austin As a reviewer you represent your community and your review should be professional and constructive The quality of the venue depends on the quality of reviews The job of the reviewer is to select high quality innovative papers for the venue and to suggest ways to improve the research as well as to uphold and or improve on the standards of the community as a whole For more guidance on the reviewer duties we also recommend Alan Jay Smith s The Task of the Referee IEEE Computer 4 90 A persuasive review includes a summary of the strengths and weaknesses of the paper and the opinion of the reviewer on which weighs more heavily and why The remainder of this document contains a few pitfalls and recommendations to help guide reviewers to produce constructive and persuasive reviews Pitfall Seek to find all flaws in the paper in part to show your expertise as a reviewer Recommendation Look for reasons to accept a paper Despite its flaws does it point in new directions or expose promising insights The community can benefit from imperfect insightful papers Pitfall Since the review process is anonymous it is appropriate to criticize the paper as if the authors did not have feelings Recommendation Your tone should be the same as if you are giving comments to a colleague face to face It is always possible to be constructive focus on the work and do not attack the researchers behind it The purpose of a review is not only for selecting papers but to improve the quality of all the work in our area Pitfall Reject papers that build on recently published new directions but accept those that build on the established norm Recommendation While truly new papers are best and rare consider accepting papers that follow up on recently published promising directions These papers allow the community to explore ideas that can not be fully developed in one paper Pitfall Advocate rejecting a paper with little comment because it is obvious that all with agree with you Ditto for accept Recommendation Explain why you advocate a rejection or acceptance because people will often disagree with you Your explanations will make you a more effective advocate or detractor for the paper Pitfall Advocate rejecting almost all papers to show about tough you are Recommendation Your job is decide what is best which is not usually accomplished by rejecting every submission Pitfall Advocate rejecting a paper because you seem to remember it being the same as or similar to unidentified prior work Recommendation In this situation the professional should reference important prior work after refreshing one s memory regarding what it contains One missing reference is usually not a reason to reject a paper

Statement My name is Joshua Cook I am a PhD student studying complexity theory at the university of Texas at Austin under Dana Moshkovitz If you wanted to see what I look like you came to the right place as of this writing Though if you just wanted my contact information that s fine too If you are actually interested in any of my work I m glad you re here I do comics and research in complexity theory This is my professional website so I ll mostly use it to keep contact information and list my publications or any other miscellaneous research or academic things Quackack com will hold most of my non research related things Contact Info Email Username jac22855 Domain utexas edu Office GDC 4 438A Publications Size Bounds on Low Depth Circuits for Promise Majority to appear in Foundations of Software Technology and Theoretical Computer Science 2020 FSTTCS 2020 Task and Timing Separating Procedural and Tactical Knowledge in Student Models in the proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Educational Data Mining EDM 2017 Minor Results And Preprints Approximating Unitary Preparations of Orthogonal Black Box States posted to arxiv in 2019 Minor result in need of significant refinement Artistic Interests Outside of my research I do web comics at quackack com Think somewhere between xkcd and smbc with a bunch of complexity theory thrown in I also occasionally make children s books or shirt designs and other random things If you are interested in any of that they are linked from quackack com and I will update there more regularly More About Me Wow really You want to know something else about me Well why not give you my life story I was born and raised in a small town in Missouri until I 11 when I moved to North Carolina I was held back a grade as a child due to speech issues mostly severe stuttering I was home schooled from the second grade until I got my GED at 17 My academic career began in earnest at a local community college called Sandhills Community College There I got an associates degree in simulation and game design before transferring to NC State While at Sandhills I made several android apps under cryospeedindustries I haven t maintained these so they are currently unavailable on the google play store unfortunately I also interned at a small start up game company called SOF studios At NC State I doubled majored in computer science and mathematics While at NC State I did competitive programming for fun and did research under Collin Lynch in intelligent tutoring systems I also interned with Amazon who offered me a job I worked at Amazon for 2 years in SCOT Supply Chain Optimization Technology In particular our team was SandOP Sales and Operations Planning I created software that helped Amazon Fulfillment Centers plan for its labor While at Amazon I got free time to work on other projects I got to take some classes at UT Austin started making comics and did internal events like making a quantum computing capture the flag category at a company wide security conference And finally I was accepted into UT Austin s PhD program researching under Dana Moshkovitz researching complexity theory and pseudorandomness Miscellaneous Things About Me I like bouldering virtual reality and computer hardware I m passionate about criminal justice reform and anti racism Cinnamon is my favorite spice I can put both of my legs behind my head I m not sure what else you want from me Please Stop Reading If you are reading this why I asked you to stop I told you my life s story other interesting things about me gave you my contact information and links to my work and my comics What more do you want from me Still here Okay maybe you ll leave after a joke Two Jaguars walk into a bar All the customers freak out but the bar owner says to calm down they have the cash All of the customers freeze not knowing what to do but the Jaguars just go up to the bar and drop a bloody wallet The bar owner takes the wallet and gives the two Jaguars steak At this point one of the customers turns around and exits the bar One of the Jaguars watches intently as he does 1 hour later the Jaguars return with another wallet There did that scare you off No Well was it funny Okay eventually I have to stop writing I m very busy and can t waste it on stuff like this And yet you still read The nerve If I am being honest I am quite upset with you Just reading and reading after I asked you to leave Okay maybe a story will make you leave One person walks into a bar The waiter asks Segmentation fault core dumped You read through that whole story and you are still here But I prepared such a long intricate procedurally generated story It is clear that I won t outlast you So to that I say good day I hope you got some enjoyment out of this I m leaving Goodbye That didn t work Okay fine You actually win This is definitely really the end Yep I definitely didn t put any more hidden text in this web page No sir I wouldn t do

detection and line following Exploring the turn push behavior from Grey Walter s tortoises similar to as implemented on the Roomba vacuum cleaner Line following and racing line followers Bonus content for students who have extra time or wish to continue their exploration after the conclusion of the camp Campers will need a computer a webcam microphone and internet access We will distribute thumb drives a few weeks prior to camp to allow campers to test the software on their machines and debug prior to camp The drive will have a runnable Linux OS installed on it but we will also provide resources allowing those with Linux machines at home to load our software locally on their machines Minimum system requirements to be determined though we have the objective of supporting as many platforms as possible Do I have to have previous robotics or programming experience No experience No problem It is necessary to be curious and interested in programming computer science and artificial intelligence Staff Dr Justin Hart assistant director of Texas Robotics and an assistant professor of practice with the College of Natural Sciences the Department of Computer Science and the Learning

academic and administrative unit sponsoring a program in which minors participate whether located on or off campus is required to register such program with the youth protection program manager or designee not later than thirty 30 days prior to the commencement date of the program Register Now During this unprecedented time the University of Texas at Austin has had to make sweeping changes for how we teach and learn while ensuring the safety of our faculty staff students and community members As a result the Youth Protection Program YPP will not host children and youth on our campus this fall We are allowing UT Austin faculty and staff to provide virtual programming so there may be opportunities for minors to participate in online university programs You can learn more about the university s fall plans by visiting https coronavirus utexas edu Thank you for understanding the university s position It is our goal to keep the UT community healthy and safe during the coronavirus pandemic Youth Protection Program The University of Texas at Austin is committed to ensuring a safe and supportive environment exists for all staff students and visitors to the campus Each year the university offers many coordinated opportunities for minors to visit our campus The programs introduce minors to the traditions of the university while providing them with a robust collegiate experience More importantly these programs are essential to our mission at the university because these programs introduce minors to our campus and community The university recognizes both its institutional and legal obligations to ensure the safety and wellbeing of minors while they are participating in sponsored university programs To provide a safe environment and life changing experience The University of Texas at Austin has created requirements that not only meet the legal expectations but also reflect the institution s core value of Learning Discovery Freedom Leadership Individual Opportunity and Responsibility The Youth Protection Program YPP was established in 2015 to create a safe environment for minors participating in sponsored university programs Under the supervision of LeeKeshia Williams the YPP will provide educational training opportunities and best practices to ensure the safety of future Longhorns As the Youth Protection Program Director LeeKeshia

http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pgoyal ##### Prasoon Goyal Prasoon Goyal pgoyal at cs dot utexas dot edu I am a fourth year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin where I am working with Prof Raymond Mooney and Prof Scott Niekum Before joining the PhD program at UT Austin I completed my Bachelors degree at Indian Institute of Technology Delhi and my Masters degree at New York University s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences I have interned at Google s speech team NVIDIA s autonomous driving team and Microsoft Research s NLP team In my free time I like reading non fiction and writing on Quora CV Google Scholar Research I am broadly interested in machine learning and its applications to natural language processing and robotics PixL2R Guiding Reinforcement Learning Using Natural Language by Mapping Pixels to Rewards Prasoon Goyal Scott Niekum Raymond J Mooney Conference on Robot Learning CoRL 2020 Reinforcement learning RL particularly in sparse reward settings often requires prohibitively large numbers of interactions with the environment thereby limiting its applicability to complex problems To address this several prior approaches have used natural language to guide the agent s exploration However these approaches typically operate on structured representations of the environment and or assume some structure in the natural language commands In this work we propose a model that directly maps pixels to rewards given a free form natural language description of the task which can then be used for policy learning Our experiments on the Meta World robot manipulation domain show that language based rewards significantly improves the sample efficiency of policy learning both in sparse and dense reward settings Using Natural Language for Reward Shaping in Reinforcement Learning Prasoon Goyal Scott Niekum Raymond J Mooney International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence IJCAI 2019 Code Data Recent reinforcement learning RL approaches have shown strong performance in complex domains such as Atari games but are often highly sample inefficient A common approach to reduce interaction time with the environment is to use reward shaping but designing appropriate shaping rewards is known to be difficult as well as time consuming In this work we address this problem by using natural language instructions to perform reward shaping We propose the LanguagE Action Reward Network LEARN a framework that maps free form natural language instructions to intermediate rewards based on actions taken by the agent These intermediate language based rewards can seamlessly be integrated into any standard reinforcement learning algorithm Our experiments on Montezuma s Revenge demonstrate that for the same number of interactions with the environment language based rewards lead to successful completion of the task significantly more often compared to learning without language Transliterated Mobile Keyboard Input via Weighted Finite State Transducers Lars Hellsten Brian Roark Prasoon Goyal Cyril Allauzen Fran oise Beaufays Tom Ouyang Michael Riley David Rybach International Conference on Finite State Methods and Natural Language Processing FSMNLP 2017 We present an extension to a mobile keyboard input decoder based on finite state transducers that provides general transliteration support and demonstrate its use for input of South Asian languages using a QWERTY keyboard On device keyboard decoders must operate under strict latency and memory constraints and we present several transducer optimizations that allow for high accuracy decoding under such constraints Our methods yield substantial accuracy improvements and latency reductions over an existing baseline transliteration keyboard approach The resulting system was launched for 22 languages in Google Gboard in the first half of 2017 Nonparametric Variational Autoencoders for Hierarchical Representation Learning Prasoon Goyal Zhiting Hu Xiaodan Liang Chenyu Wang Eric Xing International Conference on Computer Vision ICCV 2017 Most work on VAEs use a rather simple prior over the latent variables such as standard normal distribution thereby restricting its applications to relatively simple phenomena In this work we propose hierarchical nonparametric variational autoencoders which combines tree structured Bayesian nonparametric priors with VAEs to enable infinite flexibility of the latent representation space Both the neural parameters and Bayesian priors are learned jointly using tailored variational inference The resulting model induces a hierarchical structure of latent semantic concepts underlying the data corpus and infers accurate representations of data instances End to End Learning for Self Driving Cars Mariusz Bojarski Davide Del Testa Daniel Dworakowski Bernhard Firner Beat Flepp Prasoon Goyal Lawrence D Jackel Mathew Monfort Urs Muller Jiakai Zhang Xin Zhang Jake Zhao Karol Zieba arXiv preprint 2016 We trained a convolutional neural network CNN to map raw pixels from a single front facing camera directly to steering commands This end to end approach proved surprisingly powerful With minimum training data from humans the system learns to drive in traffic on local roads with or without lane markings and on highways It also operates in areas with unclear visual guidance such as in parking lots and on unpaved roads Kernel Extraction via Voted Risk Minimization Corinna Cortes Prasoon Goyal Vitaly Kuznetsov Mehryar Mohri International Workshop on Feature Extraction Modern Questions and Challenges NIPS 2016 We present a new framework for learning a predictor in the presence of multiple kernel functions where the learner selects or extracts several kernel functions from potentially complex families and finds an accurate predictor defined in terms of these functions We show that our algorithm benefits from strong learning guarantees suggesting a new regularization penalty depending on the Rademacher complexities of the families of kernel functions used Our algorithm admits several other favorable properties its optimization problem is convex it allows for learning with non PDS kernels and the solutions are highly sparse resulting in improved classification speed and memory requirements New Rules for Domain Independent Lifted MAP Inference Happy Mittal Prasoon Goyal Vibhav Gogate Parag Singla Neural Information Processing Systems NIPS 2014 Lifted inference algorithms for probabilistic first order logic frameworks such as Markov logic networks MLNs identify symmetries in the first order representation and reduce the inference problem over a large probabilistic model to an inference problem over a much smaller model In this paper we present two new lifting rules which enable fast MAP inference in a large class of MLNs We prove that our two new rules are sound and demonstrate via a detailed experimental evaluation that our approach is superior in terms of scalability and MAP solution quality to the state of the art approaches Local deep kernel learning for efficient non linear SVM prediction Cijo Jose Prasoon Goyal Parv Aggrwal Manik Varma International Conference on Machine Learning ICML 2013 We generalize Localized Multiple Kernel Learning so as to learn a tree based primal feature embedding which is high dimensional and sparse We develop routines for optimizing over the space of tree structured features and efficiently scale to problems with more than half a million training points Experiments on benchmark data sets reveal that our formulation can reduce prediction costs by more than three orders of magnitude in some cases with a moderate sacrifice in classification accuracy as compared to RBF SVMs Template

prepare a written dissertation proposal document and select a committee for approval by the graduate adviser The committee must be composed of a minimum of 4 members of which 1 must be someone whose teaching and research are principally outside of the department and three members including the supervisor must be members of the CS department s Graduate Studies Committee GSC A committee can be composed of six members provided at least 4 are members of GSC s 3 from the CS GSC while 1 can be from another department s GSC The Graduate Adviser must approve your committee prior to making final committee plans an email message will do Be sure what you send to the graduate adviser for approval includes a short description of your dissertation and what role you foresee for each proposed committee member in helping you reach your research goals The approved committee will examine the student on the proposal If they are unanimously satisfied that the proposed work if substantially completed would constitute an acceptable dissertation and that the student has the potential for substantially completing the work then they will recommend admission to candidacy 1 below and sign the required form found under the forms section of the graduate tab Admission to candidacy must be approved by the Department s Graduate Studies Committee and the Graduate School Select a date and time when all committee members can be present for the proposal At least your research supervisor must be present at the proposal It is allowable for the 3 others to attend the proposal virtually A final draft of your proposal should be submitted to committee members four weeks prior to the date of the proposal Schedule a room for your proposal through the online calendar When the administrator has approved your request you will receive email confirming the approval The Graduate Coordinator will publicize your proposal Approximately 3 weeks prior to the date you must give the graduate coordinator all the necessary information i e date time place title of dissertation and an abstract of your proposal Email is the easiest way to do that The graduate coordinator will then send out the public announcement two weeks prior to the date of the proposal This is not a firm deadline but the graduate coordinator does need to receive all the information at least several days in advance of the two week deadline to send out the information Pass the proposal exam At least 3 members of the committee must be present at the exam which may include questions over the entire depth area it is not necessarily limited to the specific dissertation research topic Questions from any GSC member are encouraged The following criteria will be used to determine whether or not a student passes the exam Does the candidate demonstrate knowledge of his her depth area If substantially completed would the work described in the proposal constitute an acceptable dissertation Does the student display the potential for substantially completing the work Passing of the exam requires the unanimous approval of the committee on these three points Be sure to obtain committee signatures on the Dissertation Proposal Committee Approval Form found under the forms sections of the graduate tab If unanimous approval does not occur a student may reform a committee or alter the topic S he is then required to retake the examination until unanimous approval is obtained After passing your proposal exam and submitting the required Dissertation Proposal Committee Approval Form to the CS graduate office you will need to complete an online Application for Candidacy This form is now available through the Graduate School s website You may begin the online application process before the proposal but do not submit it until you pass the proposal Once you submit an email will go to your research supervisor letting them know and they should approve it if you passed If final approval is not received within a week of that please contact the graduate office for follow up If you have any questions regarding completing the form the Graduate Coordinator can help you NOTE It is not necessary to fill out the Program of Work form This has been noted by the submission of your Depth Proposal or Research Qualification RQ Document A curriculum vita for any member of your committee who is not a GSC member should be submitted to the Graduate Coordinator as soon as possible either before or after completing the on line candidacy form You will receive official notification when the Dean formally admits you to candidacy At the next registration pre registration or add drop period register or add drop to 99W If it is after the 4th class day contact the grad office to make the add drop NOTE Enrollment in 2 semesters of dissertation C S 99W is required Summer may count as 1 of the semesters of enrollment You must be in candidacy by mid November in fall and late March in spring in order to add drop to dissertation hours in the same semester you advance to candidacy For specific dates please consult the CS graduate office You must be enrolled in dissertation hours continuously in fall and spring semesters until graduation You must be enrolled in 99W in the semester you plan to graduate If that s summer then summer enrollment is required What if Your Research Direction

Library TDL Because electronic theses and dissertations ETDs must be published if any material contained in your document might require permission from another party for publication all such permissions must be obtained prior to the submission of the ETD Technical support is available Click here to begin your submission It is critical that your submission be complete and correct After submission no revisions or corrections will be allowed except for those required by the graduate dean The TDL provides students with an option to request the supplemental submission of their ETD to ProQuest Students selecting this option must approve the ProQuest license agreement in the TDL in addition to approving the TDL license agreement Approved ETDs will be sent electronically to ProQuest once the degree is certified or after approved embargoes have expired There are no additional fees associated with ProQuest publication Formatting The Graduate School offers Microsoft Word templates to assist you in formatting your thesis or dissertation Before using a template review the Using the Thesis and Dissertation Templates user guide Another option approved by the Graduate School is LaTex Document Preparation Thesis Templates Dissertation Templates Theses reports dissertations and treatises must follow the guidelines of the Graduate School booklet Format Guidelines for Dissertations Treatises Theses and Reports A format check is recommended before you submit your completed work If the format has not been checked prior to submission it will be checked at the time of submission Those who wish to write a thesis report dissertation or treatise in a language other than English must petition to do so iThenticate The University has acquired access to iThenticate by Turnitin that allows you to check your report thesis or dissertation to help identify potential textual similarities between your document and other previously published documents The Graduate School strongly encourages the use of this tool while preparing drafts of your report thesis or dissertation along with discussion of the results of these reviews with your supervisor You can find information abut using this tool at https gradschool utexas edu content ithenticate Publication Processing Fees All doctoral students are charged an 8 dissertation processing fee You will receive an email notification when a bill has been created the bill may be paid online at What I Owe or in person at the Cashier s Office Requests to Delay Publication If you wish to request a temporary delay of publication of your thesis report dissertation or treatise you must make this request before graduation The request should be made by using this form If no request to delay publication is made the document will be freely available through the World Wide Web Note that it is not appropriate to use a delay of publication to avoid securing copyright permissions required for publication Any required publication permissions must be obtained prior to submitting the ETD The graduate dean makes the final decision regarding delayed publication Restrictions and or holds on publishing requested from ProQuest do not apply to the dissertation archived at the TDL Authors who already have an approved delay of publication but wish to extend the time of the delay may request an extension up to seven years from the date of graduation Authors who have an approved delay of publication but wish to publish their ETD prior to the date initially requested may request to end the delay of publication

Continuity and working from home You are hereHome Graduate Courses Former Ph D program This page describes the requirements of the old Ph D program Students have the option of graduating under this program if their first enrollment as graduate students at UT was in 2005 or earlier For steps towards graduation go to the section Application to Candidacy Graduation The Ph D is a research degree Our Ph D students also take courses which give them the foundation on which to build their research programs But the overriding goal of the Ph D program is to show students how to do outstanding research We expect all our Ph D students to become involved in research within their first semester here see Research Immersion below and continue their involvement throughout their time at UT To get a good feeling for the way in which our Ph D students are involved in our research activities browse our research web pages As a consequence of early immersion in research our Ph D students are often already recognized in the wider research community well before they graduate They regularly travel to conferences present papers and sometimes receive best paper awards Most Ph D students receive financial support from the department Each year approximately 12 incoming students are awarded doctoral fellowships which guarantee support for four years Additional students will be offered Teaching Assistantships The department s faculty also brings in substantial research funding much of which is used to support graduate students on Research Assistantships Degree Requirements Students must have an undergraduate degree in computer science or an allied field such as engineering or math with appropriate CS background to be admitted into the Ph D program Each student who is admitted must then satisfy the following requirements Background Most students have the equivalent of CS 345 Programming Languages CS 352 Architecture CS 372 Operating Systems and CS 375 Compilers at the time they are admitted If students have specific deficiencies such as missing prerequisites for graduate courses they wish to take these deficiencies can be made up by taking appropriate undergraduate courses Research Immersion Doctoral students are required to enroll in a special research course CS 398T during their first semester in the program Students entering in Spring will be required to take this course the following Fall As part of this class students will be expected to find a research supervisor with whom the student will work throughout the first year All doctoral students are required to enroll in and complete a research course CS 395 each semester until they advance to candidacy Doctoral students may not enroll for 12 or more hours unless they receive special permission from the Graduate Advisor Such permission is granted rarely and only based on written justification from the student s research supervisor Breadth Students satisfy this requirement by taking an approved set of 5 courses 2 from each of two breadth areas and one from a third breadth area Theory Systems Applications At most one numerical analysis course may be counted toward this requirement At most one of CS 386 and CS 387H may be counted See Breadth Courses for a list of the breadth courses that are offered All courses used to satisfy this requirement must be completed with a grade of B or better and a combined grade point average of 3 5 must be achieved on the 5 courses used to satisfy the breadth requirement An overall grade point average of 3 1 must be maintained on all breadth courses taken Breadth Course Waivers may be used to fulfill some breadth requirements A Breadth Course Waiver is granted when a student has taken a graduate level course at another university and that course is equivalent to a UT CS breadth course and the student is able to demonstrate a satisfactory understanding of this material to a Graduate Studies Committee GSC member who teaches the breadth course The GSC member may choose any method to evaluate the student s knowledge a written or an oral examination is possible At most one Breadth Course Waiver may be used in each breadth area Depth Students satisfy this requirement by taking a set of at least 3 courses related to their particular research interests At most one of these courses may be outside the Computer Sciences Department they are usually chosen from the CS department s list of graduate classes Courses listed as breadth courses may be used as part of a depth program as long as they were not also used in the student s breadth program No CS 395 conference or CS 398T course may be included in a depth proposal All courses used to satisfy this requirement must be completed with a grade of B or better A grade point average of 3 6 over all depth courses must be attained Oral Speaking Requirement Students satisfy this requirement by giving at least three public presentations of approximately one hour s duration Students have a variety of opportunities such as seminar courses for satisfying this requirement presentations at conferences can also be counted In the case of a presentation at a conference it is not necessary for a GSC member to be present in order to sign the form The dissertation proposal and defense may not be included This requirement makes it imperative that students be able to communicate effectively and publicly in English At least one of the oral presentations must be given prior to scheduling the dissertation proposal Dissertation Proposal Each student must prepare a written dissertation proposal and then give an oral public presentation of the proposal This will normally happen soon after the RQ document is filed The student must at this point assemble a tentative dissertation committee that has been approved by the graduate advisor Be sure what you send to the graduate adviser for approval includes a short description of your dissertation and what role you foresee for each proposed committee member in helping you reach your research goals The approved committee will examine the student on the proposal If they are unanimously satisfied that the proposed work if substantially completed would constitute an acceptable dissertation and that the student has the potential for substantially completing the work then they will recommend admission to candidacy Admission to candidacy must be approved by the Department s Graduate Studies Committee and the Graduate School IMPORTANT The graduate school requires enrollment in 2 semesters of dissertation 99R and 99W Summer may count as 1 of the semesters of enrollment You must be in candidacy by the 1st 12 class days of a semester you wish to enroll in dissertation hours so you can register for or add drop to dissertation hours You must be enrolled in dissertation hours continuously in fall and spring semesters until graduation Enrollment in 99R is required only once After the initial 99R enrollment enroll in 99W You must be enrolled in 99W in the semester you plan to graduate If that s summer then summer enrollment is required Dissertation Final Defense Each student must write a dissertation that describes original research and submit it to the members of his her committee There are many resources to help in writing a dissertation The student will then give a public presentation and defense of the dissertation research When the committee is satisfied with the dissertation they will so inform the Graduate School Additional Requirements A minimum grade point average of 3 0 must be maintained over all CS graduate courses All course requirements must be completed with a six year period A minimum one year residency after application to candidacy is required The Requirements of the Graduate School The Graduate School imposes a set of requirements on all graduate students which must be met by all CS graduate students These requirements deal with such issues as grades courses taken in residence transfer credit and time limits This page describes the Breadth course system that was used prior to Fall 2005 Students who first enrolled prior to 2006 may choose to graduate under this program Graduate courses are divided into two groups Breadth courses can be used to satisfy the breadth requirements of either the Ph D or the Masters degree They may also be used as part of a student s depth or elective program Non breadth courses can be used to fulfill depth or elective requirements A full listing of all of the department s graduate classes can be found in the CS section of the University s Graduate Catalogue One course deserves special mention here CS 395T is a topics course Each semester the faculty offer CS 395T sections on a variety of topics that span their research interests For examples of recent topics look at the 395T section of the listing of Class Home Pages Breadth Courses The courses that are currently approved to fulfill the breadth requirement of both the Ph D and the Masters degree are Theory CS 388C Combinatorics Graph Theory CS 388F Automata Formal Languages CS 388G Algorithms Techniques Theory CS 388L Introduction to Mathematical Logic CS 388S

slides Graph Challenge Champion IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference HPEC September 2017 MCD Fellowship Graduate School The University of Texas at Austin September 2014 May 2017 Research I am interested in making parallel computing more accessible to programmers in different application fields so that more people can enjoy the performance gain from parallel computing This involves programming languages compilers computer architectures and understanding of applications I work with Prof Keshav Pingali in Intelligent Software Systems research group Projects I would like to come up with programming models suitable for constrained optimization constraint satisfaction algorithms I am exploring such models by using Galois framework to parallelize graph algorithms from the following application fields Electronic Design Automation EDA Hardware designers use EDA tools to synthesize circuit descriptions to final layouts for manufacturing During the synthesis process functionality should remain the same timing constraints should be respected and area power consumption should be optimized Since EDA algorithms work on circuits naturally represented as graphs and the parallelism is hard to know statically how to parallelize EDA algorithms becomes challenging Graph analytics Graph analytics are important to discover patterns in graph data For example k truss decomposition can cluster nodes in a graph based on their shared links Since graph analytics can be realized with various combinations of programming models and implementations the tradeoff between programming productivity and implementation efficiency needs to be addressed Graph pattern matching Certain properties emerge from groups but are not observed from constituent individuals To enable such analyses on graph data we can locate interesting regions using graph pattern matching i e matching for a query graph to subgraphs in a data graph By working directly with sparse graphs we may be able to match graph patterns more efficiently than with matrix tensor forms Besides this approach allows the matching to be fuzzy to various degrees Graph pattern matching can be applied to network intrusion detection bioinformatics and verification in VLSI etc Selected Publications Please see here for the full list of my publication Conference Papers Wenmian Hua Yi Shan Lu Keshav Pingali Rajit Manohar

of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin I work under the supervision of Prof Joydeep Biswas at the Autonomous Mobile Robotics Laboratory AMRL I am interested in safe navigation for mobile robots via accurate motion models and perception algorithms that are competency aware I received my M S in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in spring 2018 and my B S in Electrical Engineering with a major in Control Systems from the University of Tehran in spring 2015 CV LinkedIn Projects IV SLAM Introspective Vision for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping Existing solutions to visual simultaneous localization and mapping V SLAM assume that errors in feature extraction and matching are independent and identically distributed i i d This simplifying assumption makes V SLAM algorithms prone to catastrophic tracking failures when sensed images include challenging conditions such as specular reflections lens flare or shadows of dynamic objects We present introspective vision for SLAM IV SLAM a fundamentally different approach for addressing these challenges IV SLAM improves the tracking accuracy and robustness of V SLAM by explicitly modeling the noise process of reprojection errors from visual features to be context dependent and hence non i i d We introduce an autonomously supervised approach for IV SLAM to collect training data to learn such a context aware noise model IVOA Introspective Vision for Obstacle Avoidance Vision as an inexpensive yet information rich sensor is commonly used for perception on autonomous mobile robots However vision systems are prone to errors from various sources such as image saturation blur and texture less scenes In this project we develop an approach for self supervised learning of a model that can predict failures of stereo vision based obstacle avoidance systems The learned model predicts the probability of different types of failure false positive and false negative and pinpoints the location of the error on the input image Friction Based Kinematic Model for Skid Steer Wheeled Mobile Robots Skid steer drive systems are widely used in mobile robot platforms Such systems are subject to significant slippage and skidding during normal operation due to their nature The ability to predict and compensate for such slippages in the forward kinematics of these types of robots is of great importance and provides the means for accurate control and safe navigation In this work we propose a new kinematic model capable of slip prediction for skid steer wheeled mobile robots SSWMRs leveraging the wheel ground contact model Inverse Kinematics Based Human Mimicking System using Skeletal Tracking Technology Mimicking is a fast and user friendly way to teach humanoid robots human
