Continuity and working from home You are hereHome Blogs Mayuri Raja s blog Ending on a Happy Note Submitted by Mayuri Raja on Thu 05 10 2018 12 09am I want to end the semester by talking about a few of the cool things that I ve been involved with this semester The semester has been hectic for sure but the end of the semester isn t just hard because of exams and final projects With the end of each semester comes a temporary halt to the activities that I ve been pouring all of my time into I have to say goodbye to the people who have made college enjoyable and enriching and sometimes that goodbye is permanent I ve had the support of a lot of different people this semester and there s no better time than the end to show my thanks by giving them all a shoutout Turing Scholars As I ve mentioned before in previous posts honors programs can be stressful and honors classes can be hard but I wouldn t exchange it for anything else I ve gotten the chance to learn from some amazing professors and interact with some amazingly smart people And of course I ve had the support of a small tight knit community that is always there to commiserate when it comes to OS problems and the honors struggle Turing is one of the main reasons I like UT and I m really grateful to the program for giving me so many great memories You can read more about why I like Turing here Anyway shout out to my Turing friends thanks for making this semester manageable whether it be through complaining about algo together or spending hours in the lab working on graphics You guys are great FRI Autonomous Robotics I participated in the FRI program because I was required to and I haven t regretted it Freshman Research Initiative usually referred to simply as FRI is a program that gets freshmen involved in research by putting them in a research stream that teaches them the skills they need to work in a lab through two semesters of classes The first FRI class was a little frustrating if I m being honest and I felt like quitting but I m so glad that I didn t The second semester of FRI was amazing we got to pick our own project to implement using the lab s resources and help and we were basically working as actual members of the lab to do real research It introduced me to research and I fell in love with the freedom that came along with it I ve mentored in the lab this semester and I ve really enjoyed it I think I ve been at least marginally helpful to the kids I ve been mentoring and I myself have also gotten the opportunity to do more research and work on cool robotics problems I highly recommend FRI if you re an incoming freshman more information can be found here Shameless plug do the Autonomous Robots stream And if you re not a freshman I recommend trying out research it s a lot of fun and it s rewarding to see the stuff you re learning in classes put into practical use Coding in the Classroom I ve talked about the benefits of outreach before but I ll say it again I love outreach I love getting to go out to a school where computer science isn t taught and give these kids the opportunity to see whether or not computer science is for them So many of them are excited at the chance to learn something new and they have fun even if they decide ultimately that computer science isn t their thing It s fun to work with kids and be an influential part of their lives of course but it s also very rewarding to see them grow over the course of the semester year and get better at something they didn t even know anything about initially I miss outreach so much and I m excited to keep participating next semester If you re interested in getting involved in outreach you can learn more about volunteering with Coding in the Classroom here and CS Roadshow and Code Orange are two other outreach orgs that I ve heard good things about Foot in the Door For non CS activities Foot in the Door has been my main source of theater opportunities Foot in the Door is Liberal Arts Honors theater troupe but that doesn t mean that you can t participate Auditions are open to everyone and they are super welcoming to newcomers Seriously I ve been to a fair number of auditions in my lifetime and Foot in the Door s audition process is so welcoming and calming that it hardly feels like an audition The level of commitment for Foot in the Door plays is easily manageable alongside a CS workload and it s a lot of fun to spend a couple of hours pretending to be someone else You get the added bonus of an automatic set of friends and network of support for the semester shoutout to my cast for being the nicest and one of my favorite groups to ever have worked with You can learn more about Foot in the Door and keep track of when their next plays and auditions are here Center for Asian American Studies If you re a CS major looking for some ways to balance your schedule with non CS classes consider taking some classes with the Center for Asian American Studies As an Asian American I ve been learning so much about the heritage and history of Asian Americans in this country and it s not like this stuff is ever taught in U S History classes You ll likely never get the chance to learn some of this information ever again and it s enlightening and empowering to learn more about a history that is so often kept hidden I ve learned so much this semester and I plan to take two more AAS classes next semester In general even if Asian American studies is not your cup of tea I think it s well worth it to take history classes of some kind You ll learn all the different ways that your high school history textbooks lied to you You can look at the AAS classes being offered next semester here and you can learn more about the Center of Asian American Studies here I m thankful for the courses I took this semester my interest in Asian American studies has only been strengthened Miscellaneous I m thankful for every interaction I ve had this semester There are people who have touched me in ways that I cannot fully express who have made my days better even if they didn t intend to just with a simple conversation Thank you to everyone who has contributed to my life in some way You ve made me who I am and you ve helped me get through this semester This goes for the freshmen I mentor in the FRI lab the friends I talk to every day the classmates I see every once in a while the acquaintances I only see once every blue moon Thank you If I had the mental energy I would write each and every one of you an exhaustive thank you card but as it so happens finals are occupying a fair amount of my time Finally I m thankful for you the person reading this It s fun to write out all my thoughts but at the end of the day writing is most fulfilling when it s read by someone I like to think that my endless rambling and theorizing about the best way to live is helping someone out there so thank you for validating me I hope that you too can look back on this semester and be thankful for the experiences you ve had and the people who ve made it possible Mayuri Raja s blog Add new comment Your name E mail The content of this field is

you need clarification The grading systems are very clear and transparent and make it easy to see what you did correctly and where you can improve Overall the lectures are well planned and the coursework is the perfect amount of academic rigor while still facilitating learning Ross Spencer The classes I ve taken so far have been very inclusive and respectful of everyone s different experience level Professors and TAs are always responsive online when a student asks a question on the material or homework There s a level of personal engagement between the students and professors that I didn t think I would find in an online graduate school setting Richie Wales Join a Community of Aspiring Computer Science Leaders Online Request more information to learn what it s like to be

Permalink How does the procmail setup in the CS department work Why can I not forward email or execute programs during delivery via my procmailrc The CS department install of procmail which filters your mail upon delivery is specially configured for our environment It is set up as usual via your procmailrc file but with two caveats You may not run a program from your procmailrc This is to protect our mailserver and thus your mailbox not only from deliberately malicious actions but also from accidental misconfigurations which would swamp the server Since our mail server does not allow user logins for the same reasons this is an extension of existing policy You may not forward mail to another user via the mechanism in a procmail recipe This is to protect the mail server from the high load and eventual meltdown that can be caused by a mail loop With these restrictions in mind the main use of procmail during message delivery at CS is to filter your mail in real time into different folders based on headers such as the score it received from our spam analysis system the sender a mailing list specific header or the subject Since we have disabled execute and forward functionality in procmail during delivery we suggest using the example in the procmail 1 man page for a template in creating your own post processing scripts The version of procmail in lusr bin which you can run manually does not suffer these limitations Search for the third occurrence of the string cron in this man page to find the example script Two changes you will need to make to that script are to change the ORGMAIL variable to point to the actual location of the folder and to provide a separate procmail recipe file to the executed version of procmail in the script the line formail s procmail newmail will need to be changed to formail s procmail path to your recipefile newmail These scripts can be run periodically via the cron 1 command to do the actions automatically or you can run them before you read mail to do something like filter out the messages or text you don t like PLEASE NOTE To avoid clobbering mail folders make sure all recipes start with 0 not just 0 The procmailrc 1 and procmail 1 manpages have more details Permalink Why has sending mail from my home computer suddenly stopped working While there may be any number of reasons for the failure many ISPs and organizations block outbound network traffic on port 25 the SMTP port that mail servers use to communicate with each other as one method of stopping spam If you are using CS s server for your outgoing mail server we recommend you use port 587 the Submission port with STARTTLS turned on For more information see our Email Configuration page if you still encounter problems sending mail please do not hesitate to email help cs utexas edu and we will try to help you resolve the problem Permalink I ve got a mail message with the subject DON T DELETE THIS MESSAGE FOLDER INTERNAL DATA and the body says not to delete the message or important data will be lost What s going on The POP IMAP servers and some mail reader software anything that uses the c client library use this dummy message to maintain state over time Because our POP IMAP server recognizes this message as containing metadata it doesn t send it to POP IMAP clients such as Apple Mail or Thunderbird so you ll normally never see it But if you use an email client that doesn t recognize this as a special message it will show it to you as a regular message It s true that if you delete the message you may lose important information such as whether messages are read unread whether they ve been seen at all by the client which could lead a POP client to duplicate some messages etc Permalink How do I authenticate with the CS SMTP mail server The newer SMTP server mail2 cs utexas edu no longer requires a separate SMTP email password so you will simply use your standard CS account password See our Email Configuration

password You can use a third party webmail system such as Outlook com GMail or Yahoo Specific instructions for setting this up will vary by webmail provider so it s beyond our ability to support but googling for other email account and the name of the provider should get you pointed in the right direction Note that many of these only allow POP access to your CS email account so if you plan to still use other email software to access your CS email choose the settings in your webmail provider s configuration carefully leave email on server in particular Forward your mail to a separate offsite address which already provides webmail such as those mentioned above as well as others Permalink How do I set up my account so that it automatically sends out a message stating that I am on

You can use dynamic configuration files using an htaccess file to restrict access to documents in your web directory For more information on this see the documentation on using the web Permalink Is there some way to have a cgi script run on the CS webserver as my own UID rather than the one belonging to the webserver software By default CGI scripts running on our server execute as the web user www this user has no special permissions Thus the directory in which the script resides must be world searchable the script must be world executable and files read or written by the script must be world readable or world writable In certain applications you may prefer that a script execute with your Unix account permissions so as to access protected data We provide a Secure CGI mechanism for doing this Warning Please carefully weigh your need for this feature against the security risks of a script running with the full permissions of your user account You are responsible for the use of that account whether by your own hand by someone using a workstation where you left yourself logged in or by someone exploiting a poorly written script which you have made available on the Web You may wish to review our policies The basic guidelines for setting up a secure CGI script are Full script pathnames should contain only printing ASCII characters They should not contain relative path components Script directories should be searchable by the owner and have the same owner group as the script file They should not be writable by anyone other than the owner Script files should be a regular file not a symlink be executable by the owner and have the extension scgi They should not be setuid or setgid or writable by anyone other than the owner Other notes Non parsed header scripts may be used with the usual nph prefix Access control directives in a htaccess file will not work for a scgi script Normally this is not a problem since the script is typically the action associated with a form in a html file which can be access controlled Of course the script is at liberty to implement any authentication for itself that it chooses Permalink I ve figured out how to set up my web page but how can I be sure that it will be programatically correct and available to the maximum number of readers This is a tough question there is definitely some content such as sounds and images which will never be universally available to blind or deaf users However for the most part staying standards compliant and making sure that your pages have no syntax errors or dependency on a specific browser is the best way to be sure of reaching the widest possible audience The canonical reference for the most popular and most widely supported markup languages HTML and XHTML is published by the World Wide Web Consortium This documentation is the agreed upon standard for web markup across the entire internet It is likely to be supported by all browsers from cell phones and text only browsers for the blind to the latest version of Internet Explorer To be sure you ve created pages that not only meet the standards but fail to have any content impairing typos you should probably run them through the XHTML and HTML validator and potentially through the CSS validator as well if you have used cascading style sheets for further page layout Be warned that older or less capable browsers may not support CSS so do try reading your page without the CSS in the source to see if all text displays fully and legibly in its absence Although it is popular to write browser specific code targetting IE or mozilla netscape and although such code may work on the majority of the browsers available today you do limit your site s usefulness by doing so Consider whether you think the cute tricks with the cursor or ActiveX controls are worth someone not being able to find the link to your resume or research Old small and handicapped accessible browsers may be unable to use your site and often will just ignore it instead of informing you The Viewable With Any Browser campaign may serve to further enlighten you as to the rationale behind creating more compatible web pages Do consider making your page fully handicapped accessible Permalink X Window System If I have a UNIX machine running X windows at home how can I run an application on the CS machines and have it display to my home computer If your computer is connected to the internet you can run ssh X hostname where hostname is the name of the computer that you want to log into The X flag enables X forwarding You can then run X

our UNIX machines before they were all updated to Trusty you may need to remove your old config files for the windows manager you are using You can use Ctrl Alt F1 Ctrl Alt F7 or F8 will get you back

Permalink I am trying to use MATLAB but whenever I open it all I am getting is a blank screen How do I fix this If you are using gnome as your windows manager and you try to use MATLAB you may run into this issue To fix the problem go to System Menu Preferences Appearance then select the Visual Effects tab Set the effects to None and close the window MATLAB should behave normally once this is done Permalink Prospective Students What type of computer should I buy We get this question often from prospective students so we asked our ambassadors experienced CS students to answer As far as computers go every CS student has access to the computers in the 3rd floor and basement labs of the Bill and Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex for their programming and general purpose needs as well as the computers around campus in the libraries and other computer labs for general purpose use The computer labs in Gates are open 24 7 for student use Therefore the type of computer that you should buy in preparation for coming to college should be one that you are comfortable using There is no departmental preference between Windows Mac Unix or Chrome operating systems In terms of hardware few classes will actually stress your computer to the point where processors overheating becomes an issue and for CS classes that require a lot of computing power for simulations or graphics most students use the computers in the labs Most computer science classes do not allow students to take notes on laptops during class so laptop use in class would likely only be for non CS courses and would probably consist of note taking For example a student recalls using a laptop with a processor that was 2 or 3 steps behind the i3 as well as one with an i3 processor and had no laptop related problems While having a laptop in college is not a requirement I definitely recommend that students bring one just in case they need to use a computer while in their dorm room As for the type of computer the best short answer that I can give is for you to bring the laptop that you are most comfortable using because you won t have to do anything on your personal computer remotely that you wouldn t be able to do on a lab computer besides take notes in class It is definitely common for students to have basic laptops for general purpose use For example a student might primarily use their laptop for note taking and occasionally remote accessing to one of the CS machines at UT to do programming If a student requires the use of a certain software or needs to be on the network and etc they typically choose to work in the labs There are students who have more advanced laptops and even desktops but it s definitely not required and most people use these more advanced systems for personal use such as gaming not because it s a requirement of the major This is why we suggest prospective students to buy whatever laptop they feel comfortable working on and has the capability to do what they would want to do outside of class Permalink Graduate What is the cost of attendance Full time 9 hour Tuition Rate 2020 21 In State 4 608 per semester Out of State 9 081 per semester For

of the cool things that I ve been involved with this semester The semester has been hectic for sure but the end of the semester isn t just hard because of exams and final projects With the end of each semester comes a temporary halt to the activities that I ve been pouring all of my time into I have to say goodbye to the people who have made college enjoyable and enriching and sometimes that goodbye is permanent Read more about Ending on a Happy Note Add new comment The Importance of Mental Health Submitted by Mayuri Raja on Wed 04 25 2018 1 48pm Mental health is important If you take away even one thing from all the blog posts I ve written let it be this you can be a computer science student while still doing what is best for you There is no shame in that Read more about The Importance of Mental Health 1 comment Add new comment Theater and Computer Science Submitted by Mayuri Raja on Thu 04 05 2018 3 52pm As some of you know I do theater in my free time This semester I was an actor in a production of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead and we performed two weekends ago Theater and computer science are completely different in how they work but both disciplines can learn something from each other I ve always stood at the intersection of the two struggling to mold myself to fit the wildly different criteria required for each I ve always focused on how my two loves are different and how participating in both gives me a varied skill set and a different set of experiences Read more about Theater and Computer Science Add new comment Taking a Hint Submitted by

Submitted by Mayuri Raja on Mon 03 26 2018 1 25pm Sometimes you have to climb those insurmountable walls There are a lot of things that I like about being a computer science student but one thing I ve found to be hard time after time no matter how much experience I have is delving into unfamiliar territory Whether it be for a class that requires a bunch of skills I don t have or an internship where I m taking on a task that s completely new to me or a project for the research lab I work with learning something new is intimidating and difficult Some people are great at getting their hands dirty and learning by doing but I m not one of those people at all Read more about Climbing the Learning Curve Add new comment The Innocence of Youth Submitted by Mayuri Raja on Sun 03 18 2018 2 05pm This was taken by me at the end of the World of Color performance at Disney s California Adventure Park The performance used projections on water along with colored fountains and music to show the extent to which color is used in Disney movies and media Over spring break my family and I visited Disneyland in California You might be thinking that I m a little too old for Disneyland but I d argue that you never can be too old the experience just changes as you get older When I was a younger child Disneyland excited me because I got to meet all my favorite characters and go on rides that told their stories Now as a young adult Disneyland was enjoyable for another reason entirely I got to watch other little kids go through the same experience as I did and I was reminded of how magical the experience can be for them Read more about The Innocence of Youth Add new comment A Computer Science Student Without a Computer Submitted by Mayuri Raja on Mon 03 05 2018 1 47pm Drawn by me to convey

2018 10 14am I don t like looking at things through rose colored glasses I would be a horrible salesman because I like presenting the good alongside the bad I think part of what makes any CS program any school any company anything good is that most people who attend are happy with where they are and what they re doing There is no substitute for pure passion and I think that kind of passion is much easier to find when you re in an environment that fits you Read more about Why I Chose Turing 1 comment Add new comment On Confidence Submitted by Mayuri Raja on Tue 02 20 2018 2 03pm I drew this picture Please don t use it anywhere else without asking me first In my freshman year of high school I hardly talked I always assumed that other people knew better than I did so I listened to what other people had to say and learned from them I never took the lead in class projects I never proposed ideas I let other people do the thinking and I simply carried out their grand visions In theater I respected my directors decisions and I went into auditions under the assumption that I would never be given a part There were other people who were better than me at acting and my only strength was my ability to work hard and follow directions Read more about On Confidence Add new comment My Problems with Perfection Submitted by Mayuri Raja on Mon 02 12 2018 10 43pm Years of going through the American public school system have taught me that I should always put 100 of my effort towards everything I do I was encouraged by my peers to get perfect grades be a perfect leader and have the perfect resume In high school I was able to block out that toxic mentality and work at my own pace Then I got into college and suddenly it became that much harder to ignore the competition around me

end of each semester comes a temporary halt to the activities that I ve been pouring all of my time into I have to say goodbye to the people who have made college enjoyable and enriching and sometimes that goodbye is permanent I ve had the support of a lot of different people this semester and there s no better time than the end to show my thanks by giving them all a shoutout Turing Scholars As I ve mentioned before in previous posts honors programs can be stressful and honors classes can be hard but I wouldn t exchange it for anything else I ve gotten the chance to learn from some amazing professors and interact with some amazingly smart people And of course I ve had the support of a small tight knit community that is always there to commiserate when it comes to OS problems and the honors struggle Turing is one of the main reasons I like UT and I m really grateful to the program for giving me so many great memories You can read more about why I like Turing here Anyway shout out to my Turing friends thanks for making this semester manageable whether it be through complaining about algo together or spending hours in the lab working on graphics You guys are great FRI Autonomous Robotics I participated in the FRI program because I was required to and I haven t regretted it Freshman Research Initiative usually referred to simply as FRI is a program that gets freshmen involved in research by putting them in a research stream that teaches them the skills they need to work in a lab through two semesters of classes The first FRI class was a little frustrating if I m being honest and I felt like quitting but I m so glad that I didn t The second semester of FRI was amazing we got to pick our own project to implement using the lab s resources and help and we were basically working as actual members of the lab to do real research It introduced me to research and I fell in love with the freedom that came along with it I ve mentored in the lab this semester and I ve really enjoyed it I think I ve been at least marginally helpful to the kids I ve been mentoring and I myself have also gotten the opportunity to do more research and work on cool robotics problems I highly recommend FRI if you re an incoming freshman more information can be found here Shameless plug do the Autonomous Robots stream And if you re not a freshman I recommend trying out research it s a lot of fun and it s rewarding to see the stuff you re learning in classes put into practical use Coding in the Classroom I ve talked about the benefits of outreach before but I ll say it again I love outreach I love getting to go out to a school where computer science isn t taught and give these kids the opportunity to see whether or not computer science is for them So many of them are excited at the chance to learn something new and they have fun even if they decide ultimately that computer science isn t their thing It s fun to work with kids and be an influential part of their lives of course but it s also very rewarding to see them grow over the course of the semester year and get better at something they didn t even know anything about initially I miss outreach so much and I m excited to keep participating next semester If you re interested in getting involved in outreach you can learn more about volunteering with Coding in the Classroom here and CS Roadshow and Code Orange are two other outreach orgs that I ve heard good things about Foot in the Door For non CS activities Foot in the Door has been my main source of theater opportunities Foot in the Door is Liberal Arts Honors theater troupe but that doesn t mean that you can t participate Auditions are open to everyone and they are super welcoming to newcomers Seriously I ve been to a fair number of auditions in my lifetime and Foot in the Door s audition process is so welcoming and calming that it hardly feels like an audition The level of commitment for Foot in the Door plays is easily manageable alongside a CS workload and it s a lot of fun to spend a couple of hours pretending to be someone else You get the added bonus of an automatic set of friends and network of support for the semester shoutout to my cast for being the nicest and one of my favorite groups to ever have worked with You can learn more about Foot in the Door and keep track of when their next plays and auditions are here Center for Asian American Studies If you re a CS major looking for some ways to balance your schedule with non CS classes consider taking some classes with the Center for Asian American Studies As an Asian American I ve been learning so much about the heritage and history of Asian Americans in this country and it s not like this stuff is ever taught in U S History classes You ll likely never get the chance to learn some of this information ever again and it s enlightening and empowering to learn more about a history that is so often kept hidden I ve learned so much this semester and I plan to take two more AAS classes next semester In general even if Asian American studies is not your cup of tea I think it s well worth it to take history classes of some kind You ll learn all the different ways that your high school history textbooks lied to you You can look at the AAS classes being offered next semester here and you can learn more about the Center of Asian American Studies here I m thankful for the courses I took this semester my interest in Asian American studies has only been strengthened Miscellaneous I m thankful for every interaction I ve had this semester There are people who have touched me in ways that I cannot fully express who have made my days better even if they didn t intend to just with a simple conversation Thank you to everyone who has contributed to my life in some way You ve made me who I am and you ve helped me get through this semester This goes for the freshmen I mentor in the FRI lab the friends I talk to every day the classmates I see every once in a while the acquaintances I only see once every blue moon Thank you If I had the mental energy I would write each and every one of you an exhaustive thank you card but as it so happens finals are occupying a fair amount of my time Finally I m thankful for you the person reading this It s fun to write out all my thoughts but at the end of the day writing is most fulfilling when it s read by someone I like to think that my endless rambling and theorizing about the best way to live is helping someone out there so thank you for validating me I hope that you too can look back on this semester and be thankful for the experiences you ve had and the people who ve made it possible Mayuri Raja s blog Your name E mail The content of this field is kept private and

ll see that part of myself in strangers the part that s just a little too eager to meet a stranger the part who s humor is just a little too self deprecating the part that skirts at the fringes of

the kid who shuffled out probably just had a doctor s appointment he had to run to and I don t have the courage to take that risk I want to tell him that he isn t alone he isn t alone and it gets better Not you aren t alone like everyone feels the same some are just better at hiding it because we both know that s a lie but you aren t alone because I ve been there and I know that pit in stomach loneliness that keeps you up all night and seems like it ll never go away I know how hard it is how futile it seems I don t know your flaws or if they even matter whether or not you re too quiet or have a weird walk or a strained smile or interview people rather than conversing with them or take jokes too far or have reclusive interests or know nothing about sports politics or Game of Thrones or share so little about yourself that even after a two hour conversation no one would be able to form any sense of your identity But I do know it gets better I know you re tempted to give up To start wearing hats just so you can pull the brim down To assume a permanently scorned expression that guarantees no one will talk to you that will make this feel less like giving up and more like a choice To live somewhere far away with a supremely comfortable desk chair and fighter pilot grade noise canceling headphones and never come to campus To rationalize it to yourself to tell yourself that friends are a distraction that you ll worry about that after you re rich and famous Don t Because I promise it ll get better and when it does it ll be so worth all those shattering moments when you

next to you how to do 6 on the homework and talk to someone every day until your chance friendships turn into good friendships It will be disappointing and tedious at first There will be people who

limited to moments of sheepish eye contact as the giant who lives next to you exits the bathroom having clogged one of the two working toilets yet again and you will have a few friendly faces in constant proximity and work will become more light hearted as you yell and laugh about failing every test case an hour before the project is due because struggling with others is so so different than struggling alone and you ll find that person you love and skip class to lay on the West Mall lawns holding hands listlessly blowing grass whistles in the sun and lectures will become less sterile and transactional as you begin to take them with friends and you ll attend an office hour or two where you and your professor laugh at the absurdity of sentences like the question of Being not only being as being but the Being of beings the nature of Being as such has not been properly thought and you will cherish these normal crumbs of life so much more because of how difficult they were for you to

disaffection you carried And eventually you will graduate Feeling sentimental you will scroll through four years of photos You will watch the progression of the occasional picture of a lecture board

Journaling Submitted by Karthik Bala on Wed 04 18 2018 12 10am The title is clickbait sorry Official Semester Power Rankings I love asking friends what their favorite semester has been and why It

The Worst Hobby Submitted by Karthik Bala on Sun 03 25 2018 4 23pm For the last six years I ve been using BSPWM a window manager for Linux along with a variety of impractical operating systems and

attempt to hack the mainframe and I look like a nerd Read more about The Worst Hobby 1 comment Add new comment Free Time Part 1 Submitted by Karthik Bala on Wed 03 07 2018 1 25am It s my last semester at UT I m in 10 hours and I have a lot of free time Last week I woke up at 9 and went back to bed the chance of something urgent needing my attention on any arbitrary day being so slim that I didn t even hesitate Sometimes I ll wake up early on purpose just so I can get that warm feeling of drifting back to sleep I eventually rolled out of bed at 11 just in time to catch my pre med roommate readying his backpack for a 12 hour day on campus Read more about Free Time Part 1 Add new comment Classes I Loved Submitted by Karthik Bala on Thu 02 22 2018 2 10am One of the best things about the CS degree plan is its flexibility As I ve written about before I m an advocate of using this flexibility to explore diverse topics When else in life are you going to study ancient Native American civilizations or the psychology of music with the depth and rigor of a college course The following are some of my positive experiences with electives at UT Read more about Classes I Loved Add new comment Finding Meaning in My Work Part 2 Submitted by Karthik Bala on Wed 02 14 2018 1 00am I ended my last post with this question When the movie is first screened to the cast and crew when the opening scene illuminates the faces of the main actors and directors what s the location assistant thinking Does he feel a sense of ownership of the movie in front of him The same emotions as the protagonist and producer Is he proud of his work or is his job so specific so far removed from the big picture that he feels like a stranger in the audience simply enjoying the free popcorn and daydreaming of weekend plans Read more about Finding Meaning in My Work Part 2 Add new comment Finding Meaning in My Work Part 1 Submitted by Karthik Bala on Wed 01 31 2018 12 12am During my monthly existential crisis I ll often draw an analogy between larger tech company employees and the cast of a movie In my analogy the CEO is the star the person people talk about when they discuss the movie E

Continuity and working from home You are hereHome Blogs Eric Lee s blog Final Lessons Thoughts Submitted by Eric Lee on Mon 04 30 2018 8 07pm Thoughts on Last Blog Post It feels weird to consider this my last blog post for the semester if not for the rest of my college career Unfortunately I will not be a blogger for the following year due to many circumstances and though it is abrupt and sad I do not consider it as a bad thing Rather I d like to consider it an opportunity to share one last constructed ramble of life lessons and expressive reflection before I head off to whatever the future has in store I hope you enjoy Reflection This past year I ve learned many things in how to live in life in no particular order commitments priorities value of friendship promises humility downfall of pride journalling entrepreneurship importance of timing serving maturity clear communication mental health strong community and physical activity Additionally cooking getting enough sleep freelancing creating good habits being imperfect being genuine rather than nice learning to say no running a business loving others in an organization stewarding time well learning to learn and many more lessons lay scattered in my mind Each word or phrase hits my mind with an overload of information A series of life events relate to the topic with some conclusions or lessons I ve gathered For the purpose of this blog post I ll share a few important things I ve learned and am still pursuing in learning 1 Journaling For my personality I find that many times when an important experience occurs I can t fully process my feelings and conclusions at the moment That s where I found the importance of journaling Taking a few mins every few hours or a chunk of time a day I write in a journal to hash out several questions I have What happened How did I feel about the experience What did I do well in that experience What are some things I ve learned What are some aspects I must improve on both for myself and others Through journaling I ve found it to be very enjoyable and fruitful because I ve gotten to learn a lot about who I am as a person It s helped me not only in understanding how I act in certain situations but also helped me in recognizing my weaknesses and improve my shortcomings 2 Creating healthy habits As an upcoming senior and soon graduating I find that there s going to be a lot of adulting that s going to happen and I can t help but be hesitant over what s to come I don t want my life to be wasted away on things of trivial importance or poor life choices One day I hope to have many responsibilities like a job and my own family and I know I will be held accountable for these important obligations With this I recognize that many of the habits that I m building up right now will influence how I live in the future If I don t learn to be structural in certain aspects of my life these habits will become increasingly harder to incorporate into my life and I will be more likely to compromise important commitments Whether it s simple things like exercising more eating 3 meals a day or getting at least 8 hours of sleep a night I hope to incorporate healthy habits so that I can do my best not only for myself but also for others 3 Learning to Say No I love doing stuff for people because I am inherently a people pleaser Nothing makes me happier than the approval that others give me because of something I ve done for them But with this attitude comes a curse There is a limit to what I can do for others and I find myself overcommitting to too many things organizations entrepreneurship volunteer services in the church or even relationships with other people Although I find value in these things my concentration and scope of ability are stretched too thin when I try to take on too many commitments all at once Because of this I often don t follow through on my obligations and I fail to give my fullest sometimes hurting people through the process It s important for me to recognize what I can do and learn to genuinely say no when it s really too much for me 4 Maturity There are many times in life when I want to give up act irresponsibly like a little child or be selfish and simply stop caring However I know that I am living immaturely if I decide to do that Being mature is a blanket statement that covers a lot of things Admitting mistakes taking on a job that no one else may want to do gritting your teeth and following a conviction clearly communicating and being genuine with how you feel even if it may hurt someone else There are so many other aspects on maturity that I m learning and still figuring out but I believe that many different aspects of maturity will be revealed as time goes on and I ll become better at living out a mature lifestyle 5 Learning to Learn I believe that education does not end after graduation but it is a task to live out every day College is only one season in life for learning only one form where knowledge and wisdom can come from I find that I ve learned more things outside of college through the organizations and ventures that I ve pursued after sales and hustling as a GCP ambassador networking and pitching through Entrepreneurship and working in a team and doing management through hackathons I m still learning how to learn but putting that as a higher priority is something I want to focus on in the coming years 6 Being Imperfect In the end I am not a perfect person It s important to accept the fact that I cannot know everything This acknowledgment is not an excuse to be lazy or not aware but rather a comfort and a reminder that there s grace in a lot of things that I do allowing me to push forward to what the future has in store 7 Community If you want to run fast run alone if you want to run far run together an African proverb Final Farewell As a closing statement for this blog post and blog whether you re a first time reader or have been reading these posts since the beginning I hope that you have been able to take away something meaningful from what I ve been writing Whether it s a small fact about Python a funny story about hackathons an intentional way to deal with recruiting or another way to reflect and look on life everything I ve written was in the hope that you would learn and pursue things with an intentional mind and heart As always thanks for reading I ve been really blessed to have had this opportunity to blog for UTCS I may not have been the best writer but I ve been glad to have been able to share a bit of my life with you guys If you want to continue to follow me on my advents here s my Medium blog where I post about faith reflection and tech thoughts Anyways I m not good at farewells but I wish y all luck in the future all the exams you re taking the advents you have and the lessons you ll learn Till next time if ever Ciao Tags ThoughtsReflectionsLessons Eric Lee s blog Add new comment Comments Anonymous replied on Sat 05

a rabbit hole leads The entrance is this small gaping hole that leads on a seemingly endless trail that has no end There is also a phrase that is associated with it called Going Down the Rabbit Hole

to a series of adventures that are described in the book Read more about Going Down the Rabbit Hole Add new comment Exercise it Out Submitted by Eric Lee on Mon 04 16 2018 2 50pm Exercise is one of

Lee on Mon 02 26 2018 7 06pm Two weeks ago I talked about how it s ok to not know what you have in store in the future That uncertainty is part of life and rather than worrying about the future it s

Uncertainty It s Okay Not to Know Submitted by Eric Lee on Mon 02 12 2018 6 17pm I remember when I started my freshman year I honestly wasn t too sure about what it meant to have a CS degree All my exposure to Computer Science had been those times trying to build websites make computer games move robots and participate in programming competitions In fact I never knew there was a major called CS I had always assumed that when I went to college I would need to get a coding or Software Engineer Major Never would I have expected that there would be something called Computer Science How is computer even a science Read more about Broad Fields of Uncertainty It s Okay Not to Know Add new comment Going Historical Submitted by Eric Lee on Tue 02 06 2018 7 01pm Slowly as the semesters go by

to consider this my last blog post for the semester if not for the rest of my college career Unfortunately I will not be a blogger for the following year due to many circumstances and though it is abrupt and sad I do not consider it as a bad thing Rather I d like to consider it an opportunity to share one last constructed ramble of life lessons and expressive reflection before I head off to whatever the future has in store I hope you enjoy Reflection This past year I ve learned many things in how to live in life in no particular order commitments priorities value of friendship promises humility downfall of pride journalling entrepreneurship importance of timing serving maturity clear communication mental health strong community and physical activity Additionally cooking getting enough sleep freelancing creating good habits being imperfect being genuine rather than nice learning to say no running a business loving others in an organization stewarding time well learning to learn and many more lessons lay scattered in my mind Each word or phrase hits my mind with an overload of information A series of life events relate to the topic with some conclusions or lessons I ve gathered For the purpose of this blog post I ll share a few important things I ve learned and am still pursuing in learning 1 Journaling For my personality I find that many times when an important experience occurs I can t fully process my feelings and conclusions at the moment That s where I found the importance of journaling Taking a few mins every few hours or a chunk of time a day I write in a journal to hash out several questions I have What happened How did I feel about the experience What did I do well in that experience What are some things I ve learned What are some aspects I must improve on both for myself and others Through journaling I ve found it to be very enjoyable and fruitful because I ve gotten to learn a lot about who I am as a person It s helped me not only in understanding how I act in certain situations but also helped me in recognizing my weaknesses and improve my shortcomings 2 Creating healthy habits As an upcoming senior and soon graduating I find that there s going to be a lot of adulting that s going to happen and I can t help but be hesitant over what s to come I don t want my life to be wasted away on things of trivial importance or poor life choices One day I hope to have many responsibilities like a job and my own family and I know I will be held accountable for these important obligations With this I recognize that many of the habits that I m building up right now will influence how I live in the future If I don t learn to be structural in certain aspects of my life these habits will become increasingly harder to incorporate into my life and I will be more likely to compromise important commitments Whether it s simple things like exercising more eating 3 meals a day or getting at least 8 hours of sleep a night I hope to incorporate healthy habits so that I can do my best not only for myself but also for others 3 Learning to Say No I love doing stuff for people because I am inherently a people pleaser Nothing makes me happier than the approval that others give me because of something I ve done for them But with this attitude comes a curse There is a limit to what I can do for others and I find myself overcommitting to too many things organizations entrepreneurship volunteer services in the church or even relationships with other people Although I find value in these things my concentration and scope of ability are stretched too thin when I try to take on too many commitments all at once Because of this I often don t follow through on my obligations and I fail to give my fullest sometimes hurting people through the process It s important for me to recognize what I can do and learn to genuinely say no when it s really too much for me 4 Maturity There are many times in life when I want to give up act irresponsibly like a little child or be selfish and simply stop caring However I know that I am living immaturely if I decide to do that Being mature is a blanket statement that covers a lot of things Admitting mistakes taking on a job that no one else may want to do gritting your teeth and following a conviction clearly communicating and being genuine with how you feel even if it may hurt someone else There are so many other aspects on maturity that I m learning and still figuring out but I believe that many different aspects of maturity will be revealed as time goes on and I ll become better at living out a mature lifestyle 5 Learning to Learn I believe that education does not end after graduation but it is a task to live out every day College is only one season in life for learning only one form where knowledge and wisdom can come from I find that I ve learned more things outside of college through the organizations and ventures that I ve pursued after sales and hustling as a GCP ambassador networking and pitching through Entrepreneurship and working in a team and doing management through hackathons I m still learning how to learn but putting that as a higher priority is something I want to focus on in the coming years 6 Being Imperfect In the end I am not a perfect person It s important to accept the fact that I cannot know everything This acknowledgment is not an excuse to be lazy or not aware but rather a comfort and a reminder that there s grace in a lot of things that I do allowing me to push forward to what the future has in store 7 Community If you want to run fast run alone if you want to run far run together an African proverb Final Farewell As a closing statement for this blog post and blog whether you re a first time reader or have been reading these posts since the beginning I hope that you have been able to take away something meaningful from what I ve been writing Whether it s a small fact about Python a funny story about hackathons an intentional way to deal with recruiting or another way to reflect and look on life everything I ve written was in the hope that you would learn and pursue things with an intentional mind and heart As always thanks for reading I ve been really blessed to have had this opportunity to blog for UTCS I may not have been the best writer but I ve been glad to have been able to share a bit of my life with you guys If you want to continue to follow me on my advents here s my Medium blog where I post about faith reflection and tech thoughts Anyways I m not good at farewells but I wish y all luck in the future all the exams you re taking the advents you have and the lessons you ll learn Till next time if ever Ciao Tags ThoughtsReflectionsLessons Eric Lee s blog Add new

Continuity and working from home You are hereHome Blogs Mayuri Raja s blog The Importance of Mental Health Submitted by Mayuri Raja on Wed 04 25 2018 1 48pm This will be one of my last blog posts for the UT Computer Science blog so I decided to use it to talk about something that I don t see acknowledged much in the computer science department mental health Especially as we approach finals week we as students tend to ignore mental health Grades we tell ourselves are more important than whatever emotional or mental strife we might be experiencing Just stay up as late as you have to work as hard as you have to push through the deep seated anxiety and discomfort you might be feeling until the semester finally ends and you can finally let yourself feel But what happens when the end of the semester doesn t bring you the relief that you re expecting As you could probably tell from the majority of my blog posts this school year has been very hard for me and I m finally ready to talk about it in hopes that I can stop even one more person from making the mistakes that I made Here s the story of this school year starting with last semester When the school year started I knew that Operating Systems was going to be hard I took the least number of hours I possibly could although in retrospect I should have balanced my coursework a little better across the disciplines At the time I saw no problem with it I thought that no matter how hard the semester was going to be I could handle it I was very quickly proven wrong as career fair interviews and building a heap for Operating Systems overwhelmed me in the span of a week I got 3 hours of sleep before career fair and then I talked to recruiters from 8am to 5pm I almost broke down crying in front of the GE recruiter for no apparent reason But it was fine I thought Once I got some sleep my mind would rebalance and I d keep powering ahead Only I didn t get sleep not immediately I stayed up late two more nights trying to finish my OS project before the deadline Spoiler I didn t finish it It was the first time I d failed so spectacularly Knowing I probably wasn t going to get even half credit for my submission I finally gave up and went to sleep That weekend I was hit by what I thought to be a sickness complete with fever and allergy like symptoms I wrote this blog post thinking that I had learned my lesson and that everything would be better once I got some rest and recovered from my sickness I started trying to change my mindset so that I wouldn t be as stressed about my mounting failures I started to feel nauseous and tired every evening like clockwork I thought it was because I wasn t getting enough sleep or because I was still sick or well I don t know what I thought was going on but I chose to ignore it I chose to believe that things were getting better even though I was still exhausted every day no matter how much sleep I got I no longer had the energy to be happy Then Hack TX happened at the end of October I didn t make the connection that maybe losing sleep when I was already struggling was not a great idea I went to Hack TX but I was uneasy the whole day I had started the day off pretty tired and I never did recover from that Some combination of the food and the environment made me nauseous and I was unable to focus very well I had a meltdown around twelve hours in the kind where you find a private corner of the Omni hotel that nobody else is in and just cry and cry until one of your friends finds you and calms you down I don t remember much else from that night aside from trying to get some sleep in hopes that it would rebalance my emotions I was still convinced that my mental state was temporary If you ask me about what happened in the month of November I wouldn t be able to tell you much because frankly I don t remember I don t remember how I felt I don t remember what happened I think that maybe I started going to counseling after the Hack TX incident because my roommate forced me to I also think the nausea started to pick up along with random nights of sneezing and allergy like symptoms I vaguely remember the constant feeling of wanting to die wanting to go to sleep and never wake up I remember that things were bad but I don t remember how bad Maybe my mind is trying to protect itself by repressing those memories I don t know I still have poems from that time but even as I read them I can t quite recall that overwhelming feeling of dread and defeat I remember wanting to hurt myself on occasion but never doing it because I knew that someone would find out I got through November purely because Thanksgiving Break was on the horizon and I was convinced that it would magically make me feel better and solve all my problems As you can imagine that didn t happen The Monday before school resumed I had a doctor s appointment It was just your average yearly checkup but my doctor made me take a few questionnaires to check on my mental health I was diagnosed with depression but it was a relatively minor case I was convinced that I wasn t that depressed and I didn t need medication because the semester was almost over I could make it through and then a month long break from school would help me recuperate I declined to go on medication and I forgot to tell anyone that I d been diagnosed One good thing about the diagnosis was that I no longer felt guilty for feeling the way I felt I knew I was suicidal because of a chemical imbalance in my brain and that helped rationalize it to some extent It also helped me connect the dots a bit The constant nausea was a result of anxiety The allergy like symptoms were a result of stress I realized that I only ever felt nauseous if I was working on OS homework I decided that I was not going to sink my time into a class that was making me physically ill and I started spending less and less time on OS I spent more and more time sleeping and the physiological effects of my depression got worse It was harder to get out of bed and it was harder to motivate myself to do things Nothing was enjoyable anymore If you thought my memories of November were shaky my memories of December are even worse I can t remember a single thing about how I felt in December It s like one giant hole in my memory I had a play the first weekend of December and I distinctly remember that on the day after my third performance I was trying to go to sleep when I suddenly couldn t breathe or talk or even reach for my phone to ask for help The feeling passed after a few seconds but I went to sleep crying that night and I woke up crying the next morning I cried for that whole day even after my parents picked me up and ate breakfast with me even after I talked to my roommate even as I talked to my other friends My mother forced me to call my doctor and get medications for depression In case you didn t know depression medications take 2 4 weeks to actually go into effect so I didn t feel any better In fact I probably felt worse Any time I tried to hang out with my friends and relax I panicked Any time I tried to work on OS by myself I felt so nauseous that I wanted to throw up or I panicked I talked to my OS teacher on the last day of classes about how I didn t think I would be able to take the exam without having a panic attack and he was surprisingly understanding and willing to make accomodations for me He told me that I should take full advantage of what the school had to offer to help with mental health Things didn t immediately get better once the semester was over I had one relapse during a family vacation the next week and I randomly started crying during a family reunion the following week It wasn t until I got back to school actually that I was beginning to feel a little better I d finally gotten on the right dose of medication and over the course of the next semester I would take the necessary steps to make sure that I didn t fall back into the depths of depression I m not 100 okay now I m definitely doing better I actually remember what happiness feels like for one thing and this semester has gone better as a whole I recognize now that if I m feeling nauseous about something it s connected to my anxiety I ve been routinely seeing a counselor so that I can work through the unhealthy mindsets I ve cultivated over the years and get myself to a better place My friends and family have been supportive of me and I m very thankful for that But I know there are people out there who don t have the same supportive network of family and friends or who aren t going to be forced into counseling like I was or who aren t going to coincidentally end up at the doctor s office in their time of need If you find yourself in a situation where you re hating life every day or where you re feeling nauseous or anxious or depressed over your classes or where you ve come to the conclusion that this world would be better without you in it Get Help The Counseling and Mental Health Center has a bunch of resources from individual and group counseling to a 24 7 crisis line 512 471 2255 Counseling sessions are now free at CMHC so you have no excuse You may not want help I know I didn t But it s worth it It s worth it to feel happiness again Make the lifestyle changes you need If that means getting lower grades do it If that means letting people down or flaking on commitments do it One short term slip up isn t going to ruin your life and it s worth doing whatever you need to get you back on your feet Computer science is hard The pressure is high But you matter more than all of that If you take away even one thing from all the blog posts I ve written let it be this you can be a computer science student while still doing what is best for you There is no shame in that Mayuri Raja s blog Add new comment Comments J S replied on Thu 05 03 2018 1 10am Permalink Thank you for sharing your experience it was really good to hear it I hope that things

Continuity and working from home You are hereHome Blogs Karthik Bala s blog It Gets Better Part 1 Submitted by Karthik Bala on Wed 04 25 2018 12 00am The first word someone said to me in Austin was howdy He was a mustached man in a white dress shirt tucked into Wranglers and a cowboy hat with matching boots I like to imagine he was chewing a piece of straw or a toothpick his horse parked outside spittoon hidden in his carry on At my Northern Californian high school no one ventured out to Texas for college No one really even knew what Texas was like Our views shaped solely by television stereotypes my friends expected me to come back in overalls having traded my guitar in for a banjo and having switched majors from computer science to cattle herding The teasing didn t faze me though because I after reading tons of forums online about how liberal UT was and how hippie Austin was fully expected to be met at the airport with a drum circle Green Party bumper stickers and celebratory beads That is up until that howdy which fazed the hell out of me My thoughts then went from I wonder who I ll meet at orientation what classes I ll end up taking what Jester will be like to Oh god am I going to look out of place for not dressing like Woody from Toy Story I should ve listened to my friends and packed some dip in my suitcase Thankfully the first few minutes of orientation showed me that UT wasn t the set of a Western but this surreal experience was the first in a long line of shattered expectations and for someone who anxiously over plans takes forever to adapt and daydreams future days to the littlest of details this unpreparedness terrified me The first unexpected problem was my nearly non existent ability to befriend strangers The fact that 80 of these strangers were from Texas didn t help They strolled in decked out in burnt orange already knowing the Eyes of Texas which organizations to join and where to live Many came from popular high schools and for them campus was already populated with friendly faces and the sea of grey New Balances and Wranglers and Nike shorts and oversized t shirts were no surprise That isn t to say people weren t warm they were mostly great but being even more awkward and gangly than I am now I found it impossible to connect with these people who seemed so different than me who I haven t been influenced by and influencing and learning to get along with for the last twelve years this same fact not stopping them from meshing with each other so well like nothing had changed amplifying my own strangeness As the semester went on they clustered into groups while I watched my face pressed against these impermeable bubbles trying to peer in for a hint as to what I was doing wrong My loneliness grew It grew as I thought back to high school as those in the grade above us returned from college like Cabeza De Vaca with crazy stories and promises of life skyrocketing in quality and I went to sleep fantasizing about this upcoming golden chapter of life It grew as I went home after finals and my parents friends with a nauseating enthusiasm said things like So how s college Isn t it amazing I m SO jealous I wish I could go back Really the best four years of your life Savor it and I briefly thought back to my last Friday night when I sat on my stained blue mattress continuously refreshing Messenger hoping my lack of responses was a symptom of WiFi issues and not some sad secret I d never understand eating unhealthy amounts of Gummy Vites scrolling through Snapchat addicted to what I was missing out on before reciprocating their ear to ear smile and regurgitating the three fun things I did in the last three months so as to not be a downer The feeling only slightly relented over winter break when I returned to my expectation less hometown to the love of my parents and to friends I truly valued rediscovering all of my incredible privileges and blessings I hid this feeling of relief as my friends like those in the year before us enamored with their new lives pined to go back I persisted in my efforts to find my people making conversation with strangers in dining halls while trying to mask my desperation only to have the acquaintanceships fizzle out due to their contrived beginnings I played board games and withstood lame icebreakers at club meetings leaving just as anonymously as I entered learning nothing about the people I had just interacted with for an hour aside from Jenny being allergic to watermelon two truths one lie and Sam being an awful liar mafia If it weren t for the two friends I had coming into UT an incredible stroke of luck I could ve easily gone weeks without any substantial conversation And freshman year a time demanding rapid adaptation was an awful time to be depressed In the background of my futile searches for promised connections I was getting wrecked by interviews which made me question my intelligence wrecked by my introductory computer science classes which made me question my major my future and again my intelligence and wrecked by Introduction to U S History which made me question my life in general I lost motivation to attend class followed by motivation to be awake during normal societal hours I stopped going to the only class I enjoyed Intro to Philosophy since it didn t agree with my 6am 2pm but get out of bed at 4pm

Continuity and working from home You are hereHome Blogs Eric Lee s blog Going Down the Rabbit Hole Submitted by Eric Lee on Mon 04 23 2018 6 02pm Do you ever wonder where a rabbit hole leads The entrance is this small gaping hole that leads on a seemingly endless trail that has no end There is also a phrase that is associated with it called Going Down the Rabbit Hole In reference to Alice s Adventures in Wonderland the main character Alice curiously chases after a well dressed rabbit with a giant watch into a rabbit hole in order to appease her curiosity leading to a series of adventures that are described in the book These past few weeks I ve gone down a few of my own rabbit holes Usually my computer wandering leads me to the realm of gameplay on Youtube for Fortnite or I end up reading several articles from HackerNewsLetter or The Hustle but recently I ve tried to be a bit more explorative with the things I m learning Last week I got to learn about mental models They are tools in a toolbox in order to map out understand the world Mental models are pretty fascinating because they are almost fundamental truths on how to intake information and react to events in life One mental model I m still trying to wrap my brain around is inversion The idea revolves around thinking about the negative things that could happen and avoiding those outcomes Rather than focusing on how to achieve success inversion focuses on managing failure I find inversion hard to follow because many times I enjoy acting more on impulse rather than through reflection and careful calculation If you d like to go down the rabbit hole of mental models I suggest reading this blog Just today I ve learned about civil engineering Someone I knew got a job to be a staff engineer right in Chicago for a civil engineering company and I got a glimpse of what it s like to be a civil engineer and hear on the importance of it for society Did you know that there is a crazy complexity behind working with construction on highways vs construction on local roads The reason is not only because construction on highways can impact the travel in many surrounding areas but also because there is so much designing and planning civil engineers need to do before executing construction Rather than thinking short term civil engineers have to consider long term in many sectors travel economy the environment and many more The challenge is to create a resilient design that won t need to be changed for hundreds if not thousands of years because it fits seamlessly well into the society even through change As you can tell these rabbit holes I ve gone down are pretty random Mental models may influence how I live daily but civil engineering may never touch my life ever again I believe though that by intentionally going down the rabbit hole it can help fuel learning and allow for a greater appreciation of life Sure it s important to allocate time in order to focus on schoolwork and get the current job done But having moments set aside in order to be open to learning new things and exploring areas that have never been explored before can refresh your mind from the mundane tasks of every day and allow for a more productive mind when you have to go back to the things you do daily in life Greetings y all thanks for reading this blog post The year is almost over and this is considered the busiest time of the semester Keep on pushing through though and before you know it you ll be able to take a break or at last momentarily pause in the summer Anyways take care guys You got this I ll see y all in the next blog post Ciao Tags RabbitHolelearning Eric Lee s blog Add new comment Your name E mail The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly

6pm Rithvik Meet the Coaches ELENI GEORGIOU Classification TXCS Senior Hometown Reston VA Companies interned at Lyft Rally Health twice Why coaching Along with being a CS Ambassador I became a CS Peer Recruiting Coach because I love helping other students Since it is my senior year I ve been through quite a few rounds of recruiting and lots and lots of interviews Recruiting can be overwhelming and I hope I can alleviate some stress that by providing the resources and support students need I ve had mentors like older siblings help me with my own recruiting journey and now it is my turn to share my experience with others Zoom Eleni ANSH JAIN Classification TXCS Junior Hometown Frisco Texas Companies Interned at Verizon Media and Instabase Why coaching Two years ago when I was a freshman I absolutely hated the recruiting process and I was definitely not good at it It was so opaque and difficult to navigate and it didn t help that companies wrote off freshmen very quickly I wish there was a system in place that could have given me direct resume and interview advice so I helped pilot the CSPRC program to ensure that other students don t have the same experience I did Zoom Ansh ASHWIN KUDVA Classification TXCS Junior Hometown Flower Mound Texas Companies Interned At Apple Applied Research Laboratories Visa Why coaching When I was a freshman I felt lost when it came to recruiting I didn t know what to do or when to do it and when it comes to CS recruiting seems to be having an increasing prevalence for undergraduates I would have loved to have a person that had went through all of it to mentor me and guide me through the process For this reason I felt like it would be a great opportunity to be a peer recruitment coach and give back to students especially when the UT recruitment resources have done so much for me Zoom Ashwin RITHVIK SARAVANAN Classification TXCS Junior Hometown Cedar Park Texas Companies Interned at Salesforce Visa Why coaching When I was a freshman like most others I had little to no experience with the recruiting process for internships Whether it be building a network knowing how to tailor my resume preparing for technical and behavioral interviews or even weighing job offers there were many aspects of the recruitment cycle that I did not fully understand until I came across them through personal experience From my own experience I believe that many students would benefit from having someone to answer such questions and help them become familiar with the process Through this position I hope to help my peers hit the ground running in their job searches and build confidence in their capabilities Zoom Rithvik WILLIAM WANG Classification TXCS Junior Hometown Austin TX Companies Virtu Financial WorldQuant Why coaching When I started recruiting the most useful advice I got came in bits and pieces from various upperclassmen It was super helpful to learn which recruiting strategies really worked but I felt the process was still too random I believe CSPRC will make this knowledge more accessible to everyone and I look forward to working with y all Zoom William LEANNE WU Classification TXCS Sophomore Hometown Katy TX Companies Interned at SailPoint Technologies 2020 Why coaching I remember as a freshman last year I had no idea what to do for recruiting or how to prepare and didn t feel confident or ready to talk to recruiters about my skills I wanted to become a CSPRC because I want to help CS students navigate the scary path that is recruiting I want to create a welcoming environment where we can talk about our fears and doubts and to the best of my ability help students be confident in themselves and their skills I received a lot of help from my fellow peers upperclassmen and advisors and I hope to do the same for anyone who wants or needs it Zoom Leanne 2317 Speedway Stop D9500 Austin TX 78712 Phone 512 471 7316 The University of Texas at Austin 2020 Undergraduate Office Graduate

facilitator will lead the weekly 1 hour seminar meetings on several topics from time management to how to turn in your CS homework Each seminar will also have a social aspect planned by their mentor How do I join During Orientation you will register for your first semester of classes including your CS Pod You will choose either a CS 312 Intro to Programming Pod or a CS 314 Data Structures Pod Don t worry The seminar class within the Pod doesn t add any hours to your schedule and we don t assign homework so you will have plenty of time to focus on your other classes Who are the CS Pod mentors The CS Pod mentors are exceptional leaders and students at UT All of them are Computer Science majors who have encountered many of the issues you may face your first year Your mentors will contact you near the end of the summer to introduce themselves and to set up any activities or events they may have planned for the weeks before classes start You will also have a CS staff member or advisor that will help to facilitate your meeting They are an experienced contact person if you have issues that you and your mentor need help solving Lucas Gates Year in college Sophomore Hometown Carrolton Texas Favorite CS experience so far why My favorite part of the UTCS experience is the amazing community I m part of and the friends I ve made within it Throughout my classes and my Pod I ve made an amazing group of friends who have continued to support each other even as our world has been turned upside down We work together stress together and laugh together being with a group can make anything better I feel like we ve all grown so much as programmers students and people in just one year and I m super excited to continue my journey throughout UTCS with my community at my side Ira Gulati Year in college Senior Hometown Plano Texas Favorite CS experience so far why One of my favorite experiences was joining the CS org Texas Code Orange my freshman year and volunteering with the club through last year In this organization I was paired with a fourth grader in East Austin and got to meet with her once a week to work on building her knowledge of coding concepts using the program Scratch We ended up creating some really fun games that included sprites and icons she designed herself Code Orange was an incredibly formative part of my freshman year and it taught me a lot about how it s important to make computer science education more accessible for everyone Additionally the org introduced me to plenty of people who I still get to see around the GDC Ruben Hambardzumyan Year in college Junior Hometown Plano Texas Favorite CS experience so far why My favorite experience in CS was being a part of my POD freshman year I was initially pretty nervous about meeting people at UT since it s such a HUGE school but what I loved about POD is that it instantly allowed me to meet so many amazing new people and gave me a sneak peak of how friendly and supportive everyone in the UTCS community was From late night study sessions and inevitably goofing off at the GDC to celebrating the end of the semester with hot chocolate at Mozart s I ve made so many wonderful memories with my friends from POD and they ve basically become like my second family these past couple years All in all 10 10 would recommend Morgan Hill Year in college Junior Hometown Katy Texas Favorite CS experience so far why First let me start by saying that I was incredibly nervous to start here but UTCS is the best department in the whole school No bias here Everyone around you is here to help you and I promise that everything is going to turn out fine That being said my favorite memory so far has been spending time with all of my new friends I met many of them through POD and other classes and every single one is happy to help each other in any situation Although some of the work was difficult hanging out in the GDC with my friends while working on programming labs was so fun There was no pressure to be perfect or to be the smartest person in the room because none of us know everything about CS and that s ok That is why we are here rst let me start by saying that I was incredibly nervous to start here but UTCS is the best department in the whole school No bias here Everyone around you is here to help you and I promise that everything is going to turn out fine That being said my favorite memory so far has been spending time with all of my new friends I met many of them through POD and other classes and every single one is happy to help each other in any situation Although some of the work was difficult hanging out in the GDC with my friends while working on programming labs was so fun There was no pressure to be perfect or to be the smartest person in the room because none of us know everything about CS and that s ok That is why we are here Nathan Jackson Year in college Junior Hometown Houston Texas Favorite CS experience so far why If I ve learned anything from the long nights spent at the GDC it s that I ve truly found a home in Computer Science here at UT Solving interesting problems for fantastic and engaging professors amongst my talented and social peers has certainly been the bright spot of my college experience thus far I ve met many of my friends at ACM and ISSS events and I couldn t ask for a more welcoming community I would highly recommend joining organizations once you get here as I can t count the number of times the communities I ve met here have supported me through rough times Niti Malwade Year in College Junior Hometown Austin Texas Favorite CS Experience so far and why My favorite CS experience is not really a single moment but rather the countless memories I have with the friends I ve made in UTCS working late nights camping out in office hours and celebrating after turning in projects I am so grateful for the community that UTCS has given me it is not only a built in support system but also an opportunity to meet some of the coolest most talented people on campus Anjitha Nair Year in college Junior Hometown Plano Texas Favorite CS experience so far why My favorite part of CS is the community I met some of my best friends at SI Sessions and in POD and they inspire me to work harder every day CS can be overwhelming and challenging at times and the people in CS advising professors TAs and classmates will help you get through it UTCS is your immediate family at UT and we re all ready to help each other out From studying for exams at the PCL to finishing programming assignments in the 3rd floor lab I have met and learned from so many people in the last year You will grow so much in CS and as POD mentors we hope to help make your freshman experience be even more memorable See you in POD Bridget O Neill Year in College Junior Hometown The Woodlands TX Favorite CS experience so far and why I really enjoyed my time in Operating Systems sophomore year and my POD in freshman year I was lucky enough to make so many amazing friends through POD from establishing lifelong friendships to animal crossing buddies to study buddies I have had a great time while learning so much about Computer Science and myself I really believe in the people in this department not only the students but also the faculty and staff that make this program truly shine I m also an OS TA so if you see me around the 3rd floor lab feel free to say hi Ramya Prasad Year in college Senior Hometown Plano Texas Favorite CS experience so far and why On my first day of school I was scared out of my mind and was unsure if CS was for me but after meeting all the rockstars in my 312 class and my pod I couldn t have felt more at home My girl group that formed in pod was a blessing in disguise and they were the reason I was excited for class everyday We all would laugh together cry together and just be there for each other when no one else was These girls became my home away from home and we probably wouldn t have met if it wasn t for Pod Javier Romero Year in College Senior Hometown Spring Texas Favorite CS experience so far and why You ll hear time and time again that one of the greatest things about this department is how many opportunities are available to meet some truly incredible people With that in mind my greatest CS experience must be working on the Huffman Encoding assignment for Mike Scott s Data Structures class Despite the agonizing growing pains from this difficult project interacting with other students and learning alongside my partner during those trying times resulted in some of the most fun I ve had in my time here The friends I ve made from that period have proven wonderful people and I m confident we ll be friends for years to come Sruthi Rudravajjala Year in college Junior Hometown Plano Texas Favorite CS experience so far why I have loved being a computer science major here at UT From participating in my first hackathon with WiCS to developing products with my Convergent build team I have learned a tremendous amount in a very short time I had no CS experience before coming to UT and I am so excited by how rewarding and fulfilling it is In my time here I have met so many kind people who are always willing to help There are so many great experiences I ve had with amazing people and I can t wait to make many more memories Amit Samuel Year in college Senior Hometown Plano Texas Favorite part about CS and why Ahh I remember it as if it was just last year I ll never forget the times I had stealing shirts and sunglasses from from tech company stands at GDC ehhem I mean exchanging pleasantries with business reps But if I m being honest the most exciting part about my 1 year so far at UT has been bonding with my professors Though they may seem very daunting at first they copy and paste code just like you and me I had the pleasure of becoming close with one of the CS professors Mike Scott He made the intimidating experience of being a first time Computer Science major at a prestigious school feel like being a seasoned CEO at insert Big Flashy Tech Company Being a CS Freshman was a new and riveting time in my life that I can t wait for you all to experience Nila Selvaraj Year in College Senior Hometown The Woodlands TX Favorite CS experience so far and why I think my favorite CS experience so far is WiCS Hacks 2018 The theme was magic and the decorations were awesome It was my first hackathon ever but it was only 12 hours so it wasn t too stressful I just had fun messing around with my friends using IBM s IoT platform eating free food collecting all the swag making a cool color changing magic wand with an Arduino and learning a lot We messed up our final presentation due to technical difficulties but we still managed to win first place in Ed Tech I had a lot of fun Ji Young Seo Year in college Senior Hometown Seoul Korea Favorite CS experience so far why My favorite aspect is the supportive talented community I m blessed to be a part of Coming into UTCS hardly knowing anything I was wholeheartedly welcomed by classmates upperclassmen and professors who helped me understand even the simplest concepts and encouraged me through challenges It s such a privilege to have friends whom I can share programming assignment struggles with as well as make homemade pizza together while watching Netflix My hope is to build this amazing community up further and help others experience such fruitful friendship Anusri Shah Year in college Junior Hometown Katy TX Favorite CS experience so far why For me it s not just one specific experience it s the community that I ve found within UTCS I m still astounded by the fact that in UTCS upperclassmen are willing to go above and beyond to make your transition into college easier and to give you so much mentorship and support I m also still in awe at the fact that the friends that I made freshman year from UTCS have truly become my family No matter what is going on in my life whether it s good or bad I know that I can call them up and rely on them to give me love and support I m so grateful to have met people who I know will be my friends for life Grant Skaggs Year in college Junior Hometown Houston TX Favorite CS experience so far why Of all the great memories I ve made at UT few come close to the experience I ve had getting to know my best friends in CS Not only have these great people been with me through stressful career fairs and final exams they ve made my time at UT immeasurably more exciting and enjoyable I ve competed with them in IM soccer games programming competitions and hackathons We ve journeyed through countless hours of Dungeons and Dragons quests and Avatar The Last Airbender episodes and we ve struggled together through just as many hours of group projects and operating systems assignments I love the friends I ve made here and am immensely grateful for the community I ve found within UTCS Brandt Swanson Year in college Junior Hometown Spring Houston Texas Favorite CS experience so far why Most of my favorite memories have come from my CS Pod whether it was in our actual pod discussion or during the times I saw friends from my pod outside of the discussion Being a part of a CS pod really gives you the opportunity to branch out meet new people and still settle into college It was a great experience and it makes the adjustment to college a lot easier Another great part of UTCS is the large amount of orgs we have I had to opportunity to be a part of Convergent as well as Freetail hackers and both of those orgs really helped me get the best out of my time in the CS program Varad Thorat Year in college Sophomore Hometown Plano Texas Favorite CS experience so far why My favorite experiences in CS would be whenever I hang out with friends that I made through POD We have made countless memories together by studying for exams working on labs at the GDC or hunting for fried oreos on Speedway They have made my college experience so much more fun and I feel like I have found my place here at UT I have struggled and grown during my time here and my friends were there every step of the way As we continue to learn here I m sure that I will grow with these friends and make memories that will last a lifetime Stephanie Tran Year in college Junior Hometown Houston Texas Favorite CS experience so far and why My favorite times in CS are definitely when I hang out and study with the friends I ve made in UTCS From late nights working on projects like bits c and Huffman to walking in the rain for ice cream sandwiches my freshman year wouldn t have been great without the people I ve met From my classes and POD I believe I ve found a group of friends that I would want to keep in contact with even when we re 70 The times we spent goofing off after studying for hours brightened even the most stressful times and still bring a smile to my face as I write this In addition to the fun we ve had I think the most impactful moments are when we learn from each other as clich as that sounds We all have different ways of thinking and approaching problems that whenever we rubber ducky each other I end up hearing completely different implementations that I never would have thought of on my own The growth I ve experienced as a person by listening and teaching other people is something just as irreplaceable as the memories I ve made in UTCS Serena Zamarripa Year in college Senior Hometown Palacios Texas Favorite CS experience so far why I love the people in CS I absolutely adored the friendships that were created through my Pod my first semester here and all the memories I have made with those people since then From late night shenanigans at the PCL or GDC to in depth discussions about time travel or memes the people I have met here have helped give me a home on the Forty Acres and I am so grateful for that I am so excited to continue my studies here for the next few years so that I can continue to explore my interests and abilities within CS alongside some of my favorite people Undergraduate Admissions Academics Student Support360 Connections Student organizations

least five business days before the day of the test Services for Students with Disabilities in the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement at ssd austin utexas edu or 512 471 6259 to seek

non refundable registration fee is the same for each test the test fee itself can vary To find out the total cost of the test you are interested in taking visit the test description page or contact the Student Testing Services office AP Scores I heard that there have been some changes to credit by exam from AP tests Why were these changes made In 2015 the Texas Legislature passed a law HB 1992 that affects the way that public colleges and universities award credit for AP tests The intent was to increase access to college credit and improve retention and graduation rates for students across the state by requiring credit for AP scores of 3 or higher What has changed The changes vary by AP exam In some cases the score range for receiving credit was lowered For example you can receive credit for PSY 301 if you scored a 3 on the AP Psychology exam which required a score of 4 or 5 previously In other cases the course for which you will receive credit has changed And in other cases nothing has changed In every case we believe that the new policies provide the best way for your hard work in AP classes to contribute to your success here at UT Where can I find out more about the changes that UT has made You can see a complete list of UT Austin courses AP exams and score ranges here When will these changes take effect These changes will begin with credit claimed in Summer 2016 If you petition to claim the credit on or after May 1 2016 the new courses and score requirements will apply Do these changes apply only to students who are freshmen during the 2016 2017 academic year No these changes will apply to all students who claim credit beginning in Summer 2016 regardless of when they first enrolled at UT Austin When should I claim credit for my AP exams It is always best to discuss your credit by exam options with your advisor S he can help you make the most informed decision about how to best use credit by exam taking into account the specific requirements of your degree program What if I already claimed credit Can I change my claim If you have already claimed credit it has been written to your student record and cannot be changed However for students who scored a 4 or 5 there have been very few changes in almost all cases the course you can receive credit for is unchanged under the new policies Placement and Credit by Exam Information Why are placement tests helpful UT Austin and its schools colleges and departments use the results of placement tests to position students in the courses most appropriate for their proficiency levels Are there exemptions for placement tests Yes In some cases students with qualifying scores from AP SAT Subject CLEP or IB exams or with transfer or dual credit may be exempt from certain placement tests For more information on exemptions contact the Student Testing Services office What are the reasons to earn credit by examination CBE There are many reasons to consider earning credit by examination including Having prior knowledge of an area like being a native speaker of a foreign language Having proven your skills at the college level for example on an AP test Financial reasons since tests can be cheaper than taking the actual course Freeing up your schedule in order to study abroad or double major Satisfying general degree requirements for introductory and or prerequisite courses Is credit earned by examination the same as credit earned by taking a course Credit earned by examination satisfies degree requirements in the same way as credit earned by taking a course except that it does not count as credit earned in residence The credit will be recorded as credit only on your transcript with the symbol CR What level of performance is considered passing for credit by exam To earn course credit by taking an exam you must demonstrate that your knowledge is equivalent to that of students who complete the corresponding UT Austin course with at least a grade of a C What happens if my test score is not high enough to qualify me for credit Ineligible test scores will not appear on your final transcript May I take a test for a course that is not listed on the Student Testing Services website Current and former UT Austin students may request an examination called a Departmentally Administered Exam DAE for credit in any undergraduate course Since the exam is administered individually by the department that offers the course you must make special arrangements Contact the Student Testing Services office for details Test Registration Information How and when can I sign up to take a test Some tests are offered on a monthly basis whereas other tests are offered at specific times during the school year For general testing periods for a specific test either visit the

when can I sign up Our test schedule only reflects one month s test dates at a time There may not be a date listed for the test you are interested in either because the test has already happened for

set to pursuing in order to gain access to the upper division Elements electives Students who do not have the certificate attached and set to pursuing will not be able to register for or waitlist the upper division courses Students can apply for the certificate here This does not apply to students who are on the 2014 2016 or prior catalogs When should I attach the certificate As soon as possible Once you have applied for the certificate and been approved via SAN please contact your advisor and ask them to officially attach the certificate to your degree profile It must be attached and set to pursuing in order to gain access to the upper division Elements courses I applied for the certificate and my advisor says it s attached but it s not set to pursuing What do I do Email elements cs utexas edu with your name and EID and ask that your certificate be set to pursuing The certificate is attached and set to pursuing do I have priority for the Elements courses No you have access to register for or waitlist the upper division courses What if I am on the 2014 2016 or prior catalog Students following the 2014 2016 or prior catalogs do not have the function of having the certificate attached to their degree profile so please email elements cs utexas edu prior to registration in order to gain further instructions on how to access the Elements courses Can the certificate be made to Stand Alone No we will not make certificate Stand Alone they need to be attached to a degree profile and set to pursuing Am I required to take CS 303E or an approved equivalent Yes All students seeking the Elements certificate are required to take CS 303E or an approved equivalent Students who have AP credit for CS 312 may claim that course and it be counted towards the certificate Am I required to take CS 313E or an approved equivalent Students who are on the 2016 2018 catalog and beyond for their major and seeking the 18 hour certificate are required to take CS 313E or an approved equivalent If I have an approved equivalent for CS 303E and or CS 313E how will I be able to register for upper division Elements courses It is very likely that you will need a pre req waiver in this case Please email elements cs utexas edu provide your name EID which course is substituting for the pre req and which course you will like to be waived for We will respond to you ASAP once we ve created a pre req waiver and it is up to you to register for the course on your own A pre req waiver does not guarantee a spot in the course You will only be granted a pre req waiver for an APPROVED course substitution Here s an example of a pre req waiver request Name John Smith eID JH123 Substitution EE 312 for CS 303E Course s to be waived CS 324E and CS 327E Which upper division courses do not have CS 313E as a pre req As of the moment the CS 324E and 327E topics courses only require CS 303E as a pre req Many Elements courses require CS 313E as a pre req which is why it is highly recommended that students take the course prior to taking upper division Elements courses We will not waive pre reqs if students do not have an approved pre req course If I took CS 303E already does that mean I can no longer take CS 302 Correct CS 302 will not be an option once you have credit for CS 303E or an approved equivalent Additionally CS 302 will not count towards the Elements certificate if the course is taken after you ve received credit for CS 303E or an approved equivalent Students following the 2016 2018 and newer catalogs cannot use CS 302 towards the certificate When should I start taking courses for the Elements certificate In order to have the best chance at completing the Elements of Computing certificate by graduation students should take at least one Elements course each semester beginning in the sophomore year Elements courses have limited seating and students will not be given special priority when registering Students must have at least 50 of the certificate completed if they wish to complete any remaining coursework after graduation additionally students must complete all requirements and apply for certification within one academic year after graduation Are upper division Elements guaranteed by Senior Countdown Attaching the certificate to your degree profile DOES NOT change its status and is not considered a degree requirement and therefore is not guaranteed under Senior Countdown or any other similar program May I take any Elements courses pass fail No All Elements courses and any approved equivalents counting towards the Elements certificate will need to be taken for a letter grade You will need to receive a C or better in order for the course s to count towards the Elements certificate How many Elements courses are offered each semester Are you expecting to add more courses to the course schedule The number of Elements courses offered each semester varies It is highly possible that we are not expecting to add more courses to the course schedule however please check the course schedule periodically because any changes will reflect on the course schedule What is the max number of Elements upper division courses I can take in a semester Students have the opportunity to take a max of three Elements upper division courses in a semester this is highly unlikely though due to the demand of the courses Can I register for three Elements upper division courses during the initial registration period No I can only register for two Elements courses during the first registration period so when can I add a third course to my schedule Students have the potential to add or waitlist a third Elements course during the add drop period What does it mean if a course is Approved through a specified semester That means if you took the course on or prior to the listed semester it is an approved substitution for the Elements certificate regardless of when you apply for certification Taking the course past the semester will need approval from the Elements faculty advisor in order for it to be a valid substitution What if I would like to petition a non approved course substitution for the Elements certificate You must be registered for the course and have received or will be expecting to receive a C or better letter grade Please print read through follow all the instructions and fill out the Elements Course Substitution Form These petitions are not guaranteed for approval and you will be sent a SAN once the Elements faculty advisor makes a final decision The final decision may not be appealed How do I go about getting a transfer course evaluated as a course substitution If the transfer course in question does not transfer directly as an approved substitution then you will need to submit an Elements Course Substitution Form after you ve transferred the course in to UT This means you must have completed the course with a C or better and send in your transcript to be evaluated by UT s Office of Admissions Once that evaluation is on your records please submit the Elements Course Substitution Form Please print read through follow all the instructions and fill out the form These petitions are not guaranteed for approval and you will be sent a SAN once the Elements faculty advisor makes a final decision The final decision may not be appealed What courses count as substitutions Courses that could be considered as substitutions are anything taken outside the Department of Computer Science here at the University of Texas at Austin This includes study abroad courses even if they are approved as Elements equivalents i e CS 329E What are the requirements for the 18 hour transcripted certificate The new requirements are for students who are in the 2016 2018 catalog and beyond for their major If you are not sure what catalog year you are under please contact your academic advisor The new requirements for the 18 hour certificate include the following CS 303E or an approved equivalent is required CS 313E or an approved equivalent is required At least twelve hours of upper division Elements elective courses or approved equivalents are required Only two course substitutions are permitted All courses must be taken for a letter grade with a grade of C or better Note You may claim AP credit for CS 312 When do I submit the survey for the Elements certification

not have CS 313E as a pre req As of the moment the CS 324E and 327E topics courses only require CS 303E as a pre req Many Elements courses require CS 313E as a pre req which is why it is highly recommended that students take the course prior to taking upper division Elements courses We will not waive pre reqs if students do not have an approved pre req course If I took CS 303E already does that mean I can no longer take CS 302 Correct CS 302 will not be an option once you have credit for CS 303E or an approved equivalent Additionally CS 302 will not count towards the Elements certificate if the course is taken after you ve received credit for CS 303E or an approved equivalent Students following the 2016 2018 and newer catalogs cannot use CS 302 towards the certificate When should I start taking courses for the Elements certificate In order to have the best chance at completing the Elements of Computing certificate by graduation students should take at least one Elements course each semester beginning in the sophomore year Elements courses have limited seating and students will not be given special priority when registering Students must have at least 50 of the

set to pursuing in order to gain access to the upper division Elements electives Students who do not have the certificate attached and set to pursuing will not be able to register for or waitlist the upper division courses Students can apply for the certificate here This does not apply to students who are on the 2014 2016 or prior catalogs When should I attach the certificate As soon as possible Once you have applied for the certificate and been approved via SAN please contact your advisor and ask them to officially attach the certificate to your degree profile It must be attached and set to pursuing in order to gain access to the upper division Elements courses I applied for the certificate and my advisor says it s attached but it s not set to pursuing What do I do Email elements cs utexas edu with your name and EID and ask that your certificate be set to pursuing The certificate is attached and set to pursuing do I have priority for the Elements courses No you have access to register for or waitlist the upper division courses What if I am on the 2014 2016 or prior catalog Students following the 2014 2016 or prior catalogs do not have the function of having the certificate attached to their degree profile so please email elements cs utexas edu prior to registration in order to gain further instructions on how to access the Elements courses Can the certificate be made to Stand Alone No we will not make certificate Stand Alone they need to be attached to a degree profile and set to pursuing Am I required to take CS 303E or an approved equivalent Yes All students seeking the Elements certificate are required to take CS 303E or an approved equivalent Students who have AP credit for CS 312 may claim that course and it be counted towards the certificate Am I required to take CS 313E or an approved equivalent Students who are on the 2016 2018 catalog and beyond for their major and seeking the 18 hour certificate are required to take CS 313E or an approved equivalent If I have an approved equivalent for CS 303E and or CS 313E how will I be able to register for upper division Elements courses It is very likely that you will need a pre req waiver in this case Please email elements cs utexas edu provide your name EID which course is substituting for the pre req and which course you will like to be waived for We will respond to you ASAP once we ve created a pre req waiver and it is up to you to register for the course on your own A pre req waiver does not guarantee a spot in the course You will only be granted a pre req waiver for an APPROVED course substitution Here s an example of a pre req waiver request Name John Smith eID JH123 Substitution EE 312 for CS 303E Course s to be waived CS 324E and CS 327E Which upper division courses do not have CS 313E as a pre req As of the moment the CS 324E and 327E topics courses only require CS 303E as a pre req Many Elements courses require CS 313E as a pre req which is why it is highly recommended that students take the course prior to taking upper division Elements courses We will not waive pre reqs if students do not have an approved pre req course If I took CS 303E already does that mean I can no longer take CS 302 Correct CS 302 will not be an option once you have credit for CS 303E or an approved equivalent Additionally CS 302 will not count towards the Elements certificate if the course is taken after you ve received credit for CS 303E or an approved equivalent Students following the 2016 2018 and newer catalogs cannot use CS 302 towards the certificate When should I start taking courses for the Elements certificate In order to have the best chance at completing the Elements of Computing certificate by graduation students should take at least one Elements course each semester beginning in the sophomore year Elements courses have limited seating and students will not be given special priority when registering Students must have at least 50 of the certificate completed if they wish to complete any remaining coursework after graduation additionally students must complete all requirements and apply for certification within one academic year after graduation Are upper division Elements guaranteed by Senior Countdown Attaching the certificate to your degree profile DOES NOT change its status and is not considered a degree requirement and therefore is not guaranteed under Senior Countdown or any other similar program May I take any Elements courses pass fail No All Elements courses and any approved equivalents counting towards the Elements certificate will need to be taken for a letter grade You will need to receive a C or better in order for the course s to count towards the Elements certificate How many Elements courses are offered each semester Are you expecting to add more courses to the course schedule The number of Elements courses offered each semester varies It is highly possible that we are not expecting to add more courses to the course schedule however please check the course schedule periodically because any changes will reflect on the course schedule What is the max number of Elements upper division courses I can take in a semester Students have the opportunity to take a max of three Elements upper division courses in a semester this is highly unlikely though due to the demand of the courses Can I register for three Elements upper division courses during the initial registration period No I can only register for two Elements courses during the first registration period so when can I add a third course to my schedule Students have the potential to add or waitlist a third Elements course during the add drop period What does it mean if a course is Approved through a specified semester That means if you took the course on or prior to the listed semester it is an approved substitution for the Elements certificate regardless of when you apply for certification Taking the course past the semester will need approval from the Elements faculty advisor in order for it to be a valid substitution What if I would like to petition a non approved course substitution for the Elements certificate You must be registered for the course and have received or will be expecting to receive a C or better letter grade Please print read through follow all the instructions and fill out the Elements Course Substitution Form These petitions are not guaranteed for approval and you will be sent a SAN once the Elements faculty advisor makes a final decision The final decision may not be appealed How do I go about getting a transfer course evaluated as a course substitution If the transfer course in question does not transfer directly as an approved substitution then you will need to submit an Elements Course Substitution Form after you ve transferred the course in to UT This means you must have completed the course with a C or better and send in your transcript to be evaluated by UT s Office of Admissions Once that evaluation is on your records please submit the Elements Course Substitution Form Please print read through follow all the instructions and fill out the form These petitions are not guaranteed for approval and you will be sent a SAN once the Elements faculty advisor makes a final decision The final decision may not be appealed What courses count as substitutions Courses that could be considered as substitutions are anything taken outside the Department of Computer Science here at the University of Texas at Austin This includes study abroad courses even if they are approved as Elements equivalents i e CS 329E What are the requirements for the 18 hour transcripted certificate The new requirements are for students who are in the 2016 2018 catalog and beyond for their major If you are not sure what catalog year you are under please contact your academic advisor The new requirements for the 18 hour certificate include the following CS 303E or an approved equivalent is required CS 313E or an approved equivalent is required At least twelve hours of upper division Elements elective courses or approved equivalents are required Only two course substitutions are permitted All courses must be taken for a letter grade with a grade of C or better Note You may claim AP credit for CS 312 When do I submit the survey for the Elements certification Students may apply for certification on the semester they are completing their last requirements They do not need to be graduating on that semester because the graduation application is a completely

required to take CS 313E or an approved equivalent Students who are on the 2016 2018 catalog and beyond for their major and seeking the 18 hour certificate are required to take CS 313E or an approved equivalent If I have an approved equivalent for CS 303E and or CS 313E how will I be able to register for upper division Elements courses It is very likely that you will need a pre req waiver in this case Please email elements cs utexas edu provide your name EID which course is substituting for the pre req and which course you will like to be waived for We will respond to you ASAP once we ve created a pre req waiver and it is up to you to register for the course on your own A pre req waiver does not guarantee a spot in the course You will only be granted a pre req waiver for an APPROVED course substitution Here s an example of a pre req waiver request Name John Smith eID JH123 Substitution EE 312 for CS 303E Course s to be waived CS 324E and CS 327E Which upper division courses do not have CS 313E as a pre req As of the moment the CS 324E and 327E topics courses only require CS 303E as a pre req Many Elements courses require CS 313E as a pre req which is why it is highly recommended that students take the course prior to taking upper division Elements courses We will not waive pre reqs if students do not have an approved pre req course If I took CS 303E already does that mean I can no longer take CS 302 Correct CS 302 will not be an option once you have credit for CS 303E or an approved equivalent Additionally CS 302 will not count towards the Elements certificate if the course is taken after you ve received credit for CS 303E or an approved equivalent Students following the 2016 2018 and newer catalogs cannot use CS 302 towards the certificate When should I start taking courses for the Elements certificate In order to have the best chance at completing the Elements of Computing certificate by graduation students should take at least one Elements course each semester beginning in the sophomore year Elements courses have limited seating and students will not be given special priority when registering Students must have at least 50 of the certificate completed if they wish to complete any remaining coursework after graduation additionally students must complete all requirements and apply for certification within one academic year after graduation Are upper division Elements guaranteed by Senior Countdown Attaching the certificate to your degree profile DOES NOT change its status and is not considered a degree requirement and therefore is not guaranteed under Senior Countdown or any other similar program May I take any Elements courses pass fail No All Elements courses and any approved equivalents counting towards the Elements certificate will need to be taken for a letter grade You will need to receive a C or better in order for the course s to count towards the Elements certificate How many Elements courses are offered each semester Are you expecting to add more courses to the course schedule The number of Elements courses offered each semester varies It is highly possible that we are not expecting to add more courses to the course schedule however please check the course schedule periodically because any changes will reflect on the course schedule What is the max number of Elements upper division courses I can take in a semester Students have the opportunity to take a max of three Elements upper division courses in a semester this is highly unlikely though due to the demand of the courses Can I register for three Elements upper division courses during the initial registration period No I can only register for two Elements courses during the first registration period so when can I add a third course to my schedule Students have the potential to add or waitlist a third Elements course during the add drop period What does it mean if a course is Approved through a specified semester That means if you took the course on or prior to the listed semester it is an approved substitution for the Elements certificate regardless of when you apply for certification Taking the course past the semester will need approval from the Elements faculty advisor in order for it to be a valid substitution What if I would like to petition a non approved course substitution for the Elements certificate You must be registered for the course and have received or will be expecting to receive a C or better letter grade Please print read through follow all the instructions and fill out the Elements Course Substitution Form These petitions are not guaranteed for approval and you will be sent a SAN once the Elements faculty advisor makes a final decision The final decision may not be appealed How do I go about getting a transfer course evaluated as a course substitution If the transfer course in question does not transfer directly as an approved substitution then you will need to submit an Elements Course Substitution Form after you ve transferred the course in to UT This means you must have completed the course with a C or better and send in your transcript to be evaluated by UT s Office of Admissions Once that evaluation is on your records please submit the Elements Course Substitution Form Please print read through follow all the instructions and fill out the form These petitions are not guaranteed for approval and you will be sent a SAN once the Elements faculty advisor makes a final decision The final decision may not be appealed What courses count as substitutions Courses that could be considered as substitutions are anything taken outside the Department of Computer Science here at the University of Texas at Austin This includes study abroad courses even if they are approved as Elements equivalents i e CS 329E What are the requirements for the 18 hour transcripted certificate The new requirements are for students who are in the 2016 2018 catalog and

approved equivalent is required CS 313E or an approved equivalent is required At least twelve hours of upper division Elements elective courses or approved equivalents are required Only two course

hole leads The entrance is this small gaping hole that leads on a seemingly endless trail that has no end There is also a phrase that is associated with it called Going Down the Rabbit Hole In reference to Alice s Adventures in Wonderland the main character Alice curiously chases after a well dressed rabbit with a giant watch into a rabbit hole in order to appease her curiosity leading to a series of adventures that are described in the book These past few weeks I ve gone down a few of my own rabbit holes Usually my computer wandering leads me to the realm of gameplay on Youtube for Fortnite or I end up reading several articles from HackerNewsLetter or The Hustle but recently I ve tried to be a bit more explorative with the things I m learning Last week I got to learn about mental models They are tools in a toolbox in order to map out understand the world Mental models are pretty fascinating because they are almost fundamental truths on how to intake information and react to events in life One mental model I m still trying to wrap my brain around is inversion The idea revolves around thinking about the negative things that could happen and avoiding those outcomes Rather than focusing on how to achieve success inversion focuses on managing failure I find inversion hard to follow because many times I enjoy acting more on impulse rather than through reflection and careful calculation If you d like to go down the rabbit hole of mental models I suggest reading this blog Just today I ve learned about civil engineering Someone I knew got a job to be a staff engineer right in Chicago for a civil engineering company and I got a glimpse of what it s like to be a civil engineer and hear on the importance of it for society Did you know that there is a crazy complexity behind working with construction on highways vs construction on local roads The reason is not only because construction on highways can impact the travel in many surrounding areas but also because there is so much designing and planning civil engineers need to do before executing construction Rather than thinking short term civil engineers have to consider long term in many sectors travel economy the environment and many more The challenge is to create a resilient design that won t need to be changed for hundreds if not thousands of years because it fits seamlessly well into the society even through change As you can tell these rabbit holes I ve gone down are pretty random Mental models may influence how I live daily but civil engineering may never touch my life ever again I believe though that by intentionally going down the rabbit hole it can help fuel learning and allow for a greater appreciation of life Sure it s important to allocate time in order to focus on schoolwork and get the current job done But having moments set aside in order to be open to learning new things and exploring areas that have never been explored before can refresh your mind from the mundane tasks of every day and allow for a more productive mind when you have to go back to the things you do daily in life Greetings y all thanks for reading this blog post The year is almost over and this is considered the busiest time of the semester Keep on pushing through though and before you know it you ll be able to take a break or at last momentarily pause in the summer Anyways take care guys You got this I ll see y all in the next blog post Ciao Tags RabbitHolelearning Eric Lee s blog Your name E mail The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly

Rankings I love asking friends what their favorite semester has been and why It reveals a lot about what they value and what influences their emotions Most people reciprocate the question and so I want to be prepared with the best possible answer utilizing the the journal I ve kept for the last 4ish years Thankfully high school Karthik had the foresight to a collection of plain text files one for each day rather than an array of fancy Moleskines so I was able to write a haphazard python script to explore all this personal data To answer the question I found the sentiment of each entry using the very simple to use TextBlob package and aggregated them by semester GRAPH 1 This seemed vaguely believable at a glance but under further inspection some semesters were definitely mis ranked Winter 2014 for example was a wholly unexceptional period of my life and shouldn t have had the worst sentiment I sorted the entries by sentiment and did someone manual investigation There were a lot of issues I had one entry that just consisted of this strange run on tried to install mopidy soundcloud and then just started admiring fonts and code quality in this random library and now im trying to change my font that had a sentiment of 0 5 on a 1 to 1 scale one of the lowest detected I m not sure if TextBlob isn t a very good library if ranking my style of speech is an unsolved problem or if sentiment analysis in general doesn t work well in these kinds of situations Intro to Data Mining hadn t prepared me for this I also realized that 80 of my entries were either heavily sarcastic or ridden with slang both situations that TextBlob or most easy to use NLP libraries couldn t handle understandably Last night was so lit returned a sentiment of 0 which neutralized half of my happy entries while this is hopeless lmao returned a significantly positive sentiment of 0 6 Failed by my optimism in cut and paste machine learning solutions I regressed to entering the sentiment of each day by hand In the future I might ask someone smarter than me for help tuning an existing NLP model with all of this newly created training data While I was originally put off by the task feeling like a Mechanical Turker it was a lot of fun going back through my life putting myself in old shoes and retrospectively rating days from these past perspectives More exciting were the results a mostly accurate result to my original question GRAPH 2 I ll talk about the reasons for where each semester is where it is in my later posts Once I accomplished my first goal I poked around for other correlations One interesting one was the length of entries vs month GRAPH 3 There s a significant spike in June On further investigation I found that these entries all tried to capture whatever new city I was in for whatever internship I was at demanding a lot of words It was a lot of complaining about my intern projects Next I tried to find a correlation between entry length frequency and sentiment looking to answer the question do I write more when I m happy or sad There was a weak negative correlation between entry frequency and sentiment meaning I journal more to vent rant than to celebrate which might skew the scores but wouldn t change the relative rankings Finally I created a wordcloud for the bottom 100 entries by sentiment and one for the top 100 entries by sentiment to see the common influencers of my emotions The findings were accurate and funny but much too explicit for this blog I ll show you if you ask Karthik Bala s blog Add new comment Comments ryanr replied

Continuity and working from home You are hereHome BIG DATA Journaling Add new comment BIG DATA Journaling Submitted by Karthik Bala on Wed 04 18 2018 12 10am The title is clickbait sorry Official Semester Power Rankings I love asking friends what their favorite semester has been and why It reveals a lot about what they value and what influences their emotions Most people reciprocate the question and so I want to be prepared with the best possible answer utilizing the the journal I ve kept for the last 4ish years Thankfully high school Karthik had the foresight to a collection of plain text files one for each day rather than an array of fancy Moleskines so I was able to write a haphazard python script to explore all this personal data To answer the question I found the sentiment of each entry using the very simple to use TextBlob package and aggregated them by semester GRAPH 1 This seemed vaguely believable at a glance but under further inspection some semesters were definitely mis ranked Winter 2014 for example was a wholly unexceptional period of my life and shouldn t have had the worst sentiment I sorted the entries by sentiment and did someone manual investigation There were a lot of issues I had one entry that just consisted of this strange run on tried to install mopidy soundcloud and then just started admiring fonts and code quality in this random library and now im trying to change my font that had a sentiment of 0 5 on a 1 to 1 scale one of the lowest detected I m not sure if TextBlob isn t a very good library if ranking my style of speech is an unsolved problem or if sentiment analysis in general doesn t work well in these kinds of situations Intro to Data Mining hadn t prepared me for this I also realized that 80 of my entries were either heavily sarcastic or ridden with slang both situations that TextBlob or most easy to use NLP libraries couldn t handle understandably Last night was so lit returned a sentiment of 0 which neutralized half of my happy entries while this is hopeless lmao returned a significantly positive sentiment of 0 6 Failed by my optimism in cut and paste machine learning solutions I regressed to entering the sentiment of each day by hand In the future I might ask someone smarter than me for help tuning an existing NLP model with all of this newly created training data While I was originally put off by the task feeling like a Mechanical Turker it was a lot of fun going back through my life putting myself in old shoes and retrospectively rating days from these past perspectives More

Continuity and working from home You are hereHome Blogs Eric Lee s blog Exercise it Out Submitted by Eric Lee on Mon 04 16 2018 2 50pm Exercise is one of the most important things to incorporate into a lifestyle After experiencing all nighters in the GDC eating snacks and sitting hunchbacked in front of a computer creds to 439 and Graphics I realized that my physical health was important to sustain in order to succeed in other areas in my life In fact health was something I tried to take account of every semester I was in college As someone who is horrible at doing things consistently without structure especially with limited time I signed up for college Physical Education classes PED in order to incorporate exercise into my life The first few semesters of college I occupied myself with Social dance both Beginner and Intermediate I found Social dance to be one of the most fun classes I ve taken besides Interpersonal Communication Theory and Fiction Writing Every Tuesday and Thursday at 3 PM I would go down to the Stadium to learn how to Waltz around the room Bachata my way through hip movements and West Coast Swing over any song is given I may not have been the best but it was a fun class not only to meet many people but also share a conversation that went beyond talking Even now I keep up with some of the social dance people from time to time and every time we cross paths on campus though we don t talk together we share a smile because somehow dancing connects people on a deeper level more than many other social events Unfortunately social dance took up a huge chunk of time and as much as I loved it I realized I couldn t keep up with all the shenanigans With this I turned towards running This was an adventurous point in my academic career At a time when structure and control were super important directly after Operating Systems I desired to have early morning classes that would force me to sleep early and set me straight for the rest of the days Taking Beginning Running took me to 8AMs on Mondays and Wednesdays regularly and this was when I learned tha2t I wasn t an early morning person Though I got to build up a running pace from 9 30 to 8 30 mins per mile I started sleeping less and more irregularly and I ended up not wanting to make it to class due to my exhaustion and lack of energy stamina So in my 3rd year 1st semester I decided that I needed to cut back on stamina and start building up muscle I had focused on gains during my high school time but fell out of it after entering college This was the time that I built up a lot of gluts but probably injured my body the most Taking Weight Training I gained insight over how to properly train the muscles but what ended up happening was after I finished the class I didn t want to take another class for physical education It was then this semester that I decided to take my health into my own hands Considering that I will be graduating within the next year I knew that there would no longer be a class that would force me to exercise Additionally I didn t want to be dependent on having a class in order to take care of my health Because of it with greater blocks of time laid out I ve tried to schedule out my own time for exercise and I ve come to fall in love with basketball Though it was a sport that had its shortcomings and I felt very out of place playing it in my middle high school years I found it to be an amazing sports pastime not only to build up stamina but also meet an amazing community Whether you re a freshman in college or a senior getting to graduate I d say that you can start exercising at any point in time It can take as little as 30 mins of your day to incorporate a routine to stay fit Sure it takes a bit of time to measure out your schedule and you may have to rearrange some of the things that you re committed to in life but being able to stay healthy through exercise will prepare you for a lifetime of benefits Greetings y all Thanks for reading my blog post this week These past two weeks have been a struggle bus of ups and downs whether it s being too busy to find time to do projects going to baptism Sunday or having some real talks with people Though things may not be steady I ve been fortunate to learn a lot of life lessons through it all I hope you guys are learning life lessons too through all the things you re doing Good

Continuity and working from home You are hereHome Blogs Mayuri Raja s blog Theater and Computer Science Submitted by Mayuri Raja on Thu 04 05 2018 3 52pm As some of you know I do theater in my free time This semester I was an actor in a production of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead and we performed two weekends ago Theater and computer science are completely different in how they work but both disciplines can learn something from each other I ve always stood at the intersection of the two struggling to mold myself to fit the wildly different criteria required for each I ve always focused on how my two loves are different and how participating in both gives me a varied skill set and a different set of experiences A couple weeks ago though I started thinking about how the two fields might be similar Now for those of you who don t know anything about theater the week leading up to opening night is called tech week by amateurs and hell week by those who have experienced it before I have no idea why rehearsals are always structured this way inavailability of the performing space maybe but to me it has always felt like the ultimate form of procrastination You see most shows don t require you to have your lines memorized until tech week or some time close to it and as the name suggests no technical components of the show costumes props lights sound set and so on are added until tech week In the course of a week you go from practicing your play in your regular clothes in a small classroom to performing in a large space with a backstage area and costume changes and props that you ve never thought about before As an analogy imagine that you have a class where you spend the whole semester working on one very large group project Like any reasonable computer science student you put it off until the very last minute and then you panic and try to do the whole project in a week with only a rough idea of what you re doing To add to your problems you re only allowed to handwrite your code on paper up until the very last week when you can finally use a computer an IDE and a debugger Wouldn t that be ridiculous You d be spending hours and hours during that last week debugging your code because you d be running into problems you never could have anticipated and you d be too tired to think through any problems you encountered You might be able to put together something that would work for the project but you certainly would have created a more impressive product if you d spent the whole semester working on the project bit by bit incrementally testing your code and integrating the different parts Theater is the same way Even though we end up doing everything at the end I think plays would be less stressful and come together better if we incrementally added components You start off with just the lines the words on the paper and your actors Then after the actors know the words well enough you add in movements entrances and exits and another layer of emotion Once the actors are familiar with their lines and movements you add in a few technical components perhaps just the props and the simple costumes And finally once you have the performance space available you can add in the lights sound set and costume changes in full The last week would still be stressful of course but it wouldn t be as bad as trying to add everything in all at once and running into all sorts of problems when things don t work well together It s like having every member of your group write code separately and then merging it all together on the last day Just imagine how many merge conflicts you d encounter and how much functionality would break I think actors and theater in general could learn a lot from computer science when it comes to implementing an incremental process At the same time computer scientists could learn a lot from the theater There s a certain polished aspect to a performance that is forged through the sweat and tears of a week of really hard work It s painful and stressful and long but by the end you ve put together something you care about and are proud of and you didn t just do it for the audience you did it for you The actors the technicians the directors everyone involved in a production pours their feeling into that final product I think when it comes to computer science we re very often just doing what we can for the sake of doing it not always because we care We often fall into this pattern of creating products because we re told to pushing the boundaries of research simply because we can and our work can lose that personal touch Yet there was some passion some driving force that got us working on that project or that team in the first place and we should remember that and incorporate that passion into our work not just in how quickly we work but how well we work A final product created by loving hands is far better than one created by impersonal code monkeys At the end of the day I m still going to have to keep stretching to be the ideal performer and the ideal programmer at the same time But perhaps if I can focus on the ways that one field is honing my skills for the other I won t have to stretch quite as hard When it comes down to it theater and computer science are simply different expressions of humanity different avenues through which the beauty of thought and feeling are presented Perhaps theater is more poetic and computer science is more practical but they both have their uses for me and for the world Mayuri Raja s blog Add new comment Your name E mail The content of this

Syndrome and the discontented restlessness it produces leads to many improbable daydreams and fantasies about alternate life paths The theme of my latest episode thankfully much milder than wanting to move to Hawaii to pursue hula dancing was career regret I imagined myself happier in a business y role a consulting or operations or analyst job or something of the sort and kicked myself for never exploring other options in the precious four years when it s easiest to I felt that I had pigeonholed myself into tech and would spend the rest of my life positioning divs while numbing the pain with

bin Jordan Belfort wannabe I d be behind my business friends who ve been snaking networking and resume padding for the last four years I decided to mention my worry to my parents more so to change the subject from what I was eating or when I was sleeping than to solicit advice Most of the advice my parents give me has no correlation to the problem at hand It s like they pick slips out of a hat of

difficult to internalize cliches such as you shouldn t compare yourself to anybody but yourself do what makes you happy not what looks the best my dad dropped some truly impactful advice the kind of advice you get from a self help book that starts with a case study on an individual who followed it so you know the claim is substantiated in some way He listed off his college friends all in their 50s now all super successful in their own ways and how they got there The best engineer he knew is now a spiritual consultant who writes abstract blog posts and barely uses technology Another friend of his worked on electronics for 15 years before deciding to go to business school in his late 30s and is now a consultant in a field that has absolutely nothing to do with his education or work experience In fact most of his friends even the ones that seemed 100 set on further pursuing what they studied bounced around from career to career well into adulthood and they were happier because of it thoroughly exploring each pasture to ensure that when they settled on a side the grass wasn t greener on the other It s ridiculous to get hung up on finding your life passion in the first quarter of your life and force yourself to commit to it for the other three You have no idea how you re going to evolve or how the people you re comparing yourself to are going to evolve You can loosely model

put my blinders on and force myself to enjoy the job I had lined up but to calm down and treat each phase of life as a necessary learning experience that d get me closer to that greenest field almost

Innocence of Youth Submitted by Mayuri Raja on Sun 03 18 2018 2 05pm This was taken by me at the end of the World of Color performance at Disney s California Adventure Park The performance used projections on water along with colored fountains and music to show the extent to which color is used in Disney movies and media Over spring break my family and I visited Disneyland in California You might be thinking that I m a little too old for Disneyland but I d argue that you never can be too old the experience just changes as you get older When I was a younger child Disneyland excited me because I got to meet all my favorite characters and go on rides that told their stories Now as a young adult Disneyland was enjoyable for another reason entirely I got to watch other little kids go through the same experience as I did and I was reminded of how magical the experience can be for them Read more about The Innocence of Youth Mayuri Raja s blog Add new comment Free Time Part 1

2018 10 14am I don t like looking at things through rose colored glasses I would be a horrible salesman because I like presenting the good alongside the bad I think part of what makes any CS program any school any company anything good is that most people who attend are happy with where they are and what they re doing There is no substitute for pure passion and I think that kind of passion is much easier to find when you re in an environment that fits you Read more about Why I Chose Turing Mayuri Raja s blog 1 comment Add new comment Pages first previous 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 next last The

02 22 2018 2 10am One of the best things about the CS degree plan is its flexibility As I ve written about before I m an advocate of using this flexibility to explore diverse topics When else in life

asking me first In my freshman year of high school I hardly talked I always assumed that other people knew better than I did so I listened to what other people had to say and learned from them I never took the lead in class projects I never proposed ideas I let other people do the thinking and I simply carried out their grand visions In theater I respected my directors decisions and I went into auditions under the assumption that I would never be given a part There were other people who were better than me at acting and my only strength was my ability to work hard and follow directions Read

movie in front of him The same emotions as the protagonist and producer Is he proud of his work or is his job so specific so far removed from the big picture that he feels like a stranger in the

by Mayuri Raja on Mon 02 12 2018 10 43pm Years of going through the American public school system have taught me that I should always put 100 of my effort towards everything I do I was encouraged by

been those times trying to build websites make computer games move robots and participate in programming competitions In fact I never knew there was a major called CS I had always assumed that when I

experience there are two types of college schedules you can end up with after going through the nightmare that is registration The first type of schedule is the balanced schedule you have a few classes every day perhaps all in a row or evenly spaced out through each day The second type of schedule is the lopsided schedule with all of your classes on two or three days and multiple days during

even property content encoded p I want to end the semester by talking about a few of the cool things that I ve been involved with this semester The semester has been hectic for sure but the end of the semester isn t just hard because of exams and final projects With the end of each semester comes a temporary halt to the activities that I ve been pouring all of my time into I have to say goodbye to the people who have made college enjoyable and enriching and sometimes that goodbye is permanent I ve had the support of a lot of different people this semester and there s no better time than the end to show my thanks by giving them all a shoutout p p strong Turing strong strong Scholars strong p p As I ve mentioned before in previous posts honors programs can be stressful and honors classes can be hard but I wouldn t exchange it for anything else I ve gotten the chance to learn from some amazing professors and interact with some amazingly smart people And of course I ve had the support of a small tight knit community that is always there to commiserate when it comes to OS problems and the honors struggle Turing is one of the main reasons I like UT and I m really grateful to the program for giving me so many great memories You can read more about why I like Turing a href https www cs utexas edu blog why i chose turing here a Anyway shout out to my Turing friends thanks for making this semester manageable whether it be through complaining about algo together or spending a href https www cs utexas edu blog phenomenon gdc labs hours in the lab a working on graphics You guys are great p p strong FRI Autonomous Robotics strong p p I participated in the FRI program because I was required to and I haven t regretted it Freshman Research Initiative usually referred to simply as FRI is a program that gets freshmen involved in research by putting them in a research stream that teaches them the skills they need to work in a lab through two semesters of classes The first FRI class was a little frustrating if I m being honest and I felt like quitting but I m so glad that I didn t The second semester of FRI was em amazing em we got to pick our own project to implement using the lab s resources and help and we were basically working as actual members of the lab to do real research It introduced me to research and I fell in love with the freedom that came along with it I ve mentored in the lab this semester and I ve really enjoyed it I think I ve been at least marginally helpful to the kids I ve been mentoring and I myself have also gotten the opportunity to do more research and work on cool robotics problems I highly recommend FRI if you re an incoming freshman more information can be found a href https cns utexas edu fri here a Shameless plug do the Autonomous Robots stream And if you re not a freshman I recommend trying out research it s a lot of fun and it s rewarding to see the stuff you re learning in classes put into practical use p p strong Coding in the Classroom strong p p a href https www cs utexas edu blog importance outreach I ve talked about the benefits of outreach before a but I ll say it again I love outreach I love getting to go out to a school where computer science isn t taught and give these kids the opportunity to see whether or not computer science is for them So many of them are excited at the chance to learn something new and they have fun even if they decide ultimately that computer science isn t their thing It s fun to work with kids and be an influential part of their lives of course but it s also very rewarding to see them grow over the course of the semester year and get better at something they didn t even know anything about initially I miss outreach so much and I m excited to keep participating next semester If you re interested in getting involved in outreach you can learn more about volunteering with a href http www cs utexas edu ans outreach index html Coding in the Classroom a here and a href https www cs utexas edu outreach roadshow CS Roadshow a and a href https www facebook com codeorangetx ref br rs Code Orange a are two other outreach orgs that I ve heard good things about p p strong Foot in the Door strong p p For non CS activities Foot in the Door has been my main source of theater opportunities Foot in the Door is Liberal Arts Honors theater troupe but that doesn t mean that you can t participate Auditions are open to everyone and they are super welcoming to newcomers Seriously I ve been to a fair number of auditions in my lifetime and Foot in the Door s audition process is so welcoming and calming that it hardly feels like an audition The level of commitment for Foot in the Door plays is easily manageable alongside a CS workload and it s a lot of fun to spend a couple of hours pretending to be someone else You get the added bonus of an automatic set of friends and network of support for the semester shoutout to my cast for being the nicest and one of my favorite groups to ever have worked with You can learn more about Foot in the Door and keep track of when their next plays and auditions are a href https www facebook com FITDtheatre here a p p strong Center for Asian American Studies strong p p If you re a CS major looking for some ways to balance your schedule with non CS classes consider taking some classes with the Center for Asian American Studies As an Asian American I ve been learning so much about the heritage and history of Asian Americans in this country and it s not like this stuff is ever taught in U S History classes You ll likely never get the chance to learn some of this information ever again and it s enlightening and empowering to learn more about a history that is so often kept hidden I ve learned so much this semester and I plan to take two more AAS classes next semester In general even if Asian American studies is not your cup of tea I think it s well worth it to take history classes of some kind You ll learn all the different ways that your high school history textbooks lied to you You can look at the AAS classes being offered next semester a href https liberalarts utexas edu aas courses index php here a and you can learn more about the Center of Asian American Studies a href https liberalarts utexas edu aas here a I m thankful for the courses I took this semester my interest in Asian American studies has only been strengthened p p strong Miscellaneous strong p p I m thankful for every interaction I ve had this semester There are people who have touched me in ways that I cannot fully express who have made my days better even if they didn t intend to just with a simple conversation Thank you to everyone who has contributed to my life in some way You ve made me who I am and you ve helped me get through this semester This goes for the freshmen I mentor in the FRI lab the friends I talk to every day the classmates I see every once in a while the acquaintances I only see once every blue moon Thank you If I had the mental energy I would write each and every one of you an exhaustive thank you card but as it so happens finals are occupying a fair amount of my time p p Finally I m thankful for you the person reading this It s fun to write out all my thoughts but at the end of the day writing is most fulfilling when it s read by someone I like to think that my endless rambling and theorizing about the best way to live is helping someone out there so thank you for validating me I hope that you too can look back on this semester and be thankful for the experiences you ve had and the people who ve made it possible p div div div Thu 10 May 2018 05 09 49 0000 Mayuri Raja 72026 at https www cs utexas edu https www cs utexas edu blog ending happy note comments It Gets Better Part

peppy students clad in burnt orange jumpsuits whose first word was Bevo and still Hook em d in pictures a decade after graduating Their natural happiness evinced the perfection of my situation and so I felt increasingly personally responsible for this loneliness p p Still fixing myself seemed impossible Friends excel at questions like yo should I cop these shoes or yo what classes should I take next sem not yo is there something wrong with me am I unlikable is it my actions or something more fundamental do you talk to me out of an obligation of politeness why didn t you respond to my texts this isn t rhetorical or an accusation I genuinely want to know your thought process so i can improve and if you say I fell asleep i m going to scream can you please please please please enumerate my flaws without being nice I mean actually tell me because nothing I try is working because your desperate self doubt will scare away the few you have and the ones that stay will try their hardest to avoid planting insecurities in this fragile person in front of them and so you are left with unhelpful but well intentioned evasions like uh haha idk I think you re cool maybe try joining something else p p Even now only a few years removed from this period of my own life I m cringing for this person all I can give him is an uneasy sympathy Sometimes I ll see that part of myself in strangers the part that s just a little too eager to meet a stranger the part who s humor is just a little too self deprecating the part that skirts at the fringes of groups the part that lingers for a moment after club meetings hoping he will be graciously enveloped by one of the circles around him that are talking and laughing before the empty space between him and everyone else makes itself painfully apparent and he quickly shuffles out of the room I want to hug these people and tell them it gets better but I don t because I m probably just projecting and the kid who shuffled out probably just had a doctor s appointment he had to run to and I don t have the courage to take that risk p p I want to tell him that he isn t alone he isn t alone and it gets better Not you aren t alone like everyone feels the same some are just better at hiding it because we both know that s a lie but you aren t alone because I ve been there and I know that pit in stomach loneliness that keeps you up all night and seems like it ll never go away I know how hard it is how futile it seems I don t know your flaws or if they even matter whether or not you re too quiet or have a weird walk or a strained smile or interview people rather than conversing with them or take jokes too far or have reclusive interests or know nothing about sports politics or Game of Thrones or share so little about yourself that even after a two hour conversation no one would be able to form any sense of your identity But I do know it gets better p p I know you re tempted to give up To start wearing hats just so you can pull the brim down To assume a permanently scorned expression that guarantees no one will talk to you that will make this feel less like giving up and more like a choice To live somewhere far away with a supremely comfortable desk chair and fighter pilot grade noise canceling headphones and never come to campus To rationalize it to yourself to tell yourself that friends are a distraction that you ll worry about that after you re rich and famous p p Don t Because I promise it ll get better and when it does it ll be so worth all those shattering moments when you finally muster up the courage to be vulnerable to expose your fragile ego to the world only to have it turn away p p It ll get better because your probability of making a connection isn t zero You aren t that special Maybe it s a fraction of a percent 0 2 For five hundred people you talk to there is one that reciprocates and will eventually accept enough of you to where it doesn t feel like you re wearing a mask p p Then you go talk to five hundred people You live in the dorms another year even if Kins is trash and join more clubs in spite of none of them having worked out yet and ask the person next to you how to do 6 on the homework and talk to someone every day until your chance friendships turn into good friendships It will be disappointing and tedious at first There will be people who think you re weird overbearing desperate and it will hurt but the acute pain of rejection pales in comparison to the persistent gnawing pain of living life anonymously All you need is a few successes and then you ll meet friends of friends and your probabilities will increase and you will finally feel contentment p p You ll finally ask real people for help rather than Google every question on your problem set only to find one desperate query by Adam128 on Yahoo Answers in 2005 and filled with the motivation that comes with knowing you won t be stuck forever more of your life will fall into place You ll finally be connected to the domineering campus walls you used to be intimidated by and your dorm will no longer feel suffocating your interactions with your co inhabitants no longer limited to moments of sheepish eye contact as the giant who lives next to you exits the bathroom having clogged one of the two working toilets yet again and you will have a few friendly faces in constant proximity and work will become more light hearted as you yell and laugh about failing every test case an hour before the project is due because struggling with others is so so different than struggling alone and you ll find that person you love and skip class to lay on the West Mall lawns holding hands listlessly blowing grass whistles in the sun and lectures will become less sterile and transactional as you begin to take them with friends and you ll attend an office hour or two where you and your professor laugh at the absurdity of sentences like the question of Being not only being as being but the Being of beings the nature of Being as such has not been properly thought and you will cherish these normal crumbs of life so much more because of how difficult they were for you to find p p You will go back home and your friends will again ask you hows UT going and you ll reflexively begin to bash it but then catch yourself because as you search for your mental list of Reasons To Be Sad all you can find are memories of drunken cliff jumping into Lake Travis and stargazing on the roof of Chipotle and all those till sunrise conversations that slowly erased the deep seated disaffection you carried p p And eventually you will graduate Feeling sentimental you will scroll through four years of photos You will watch the progression of the occasional picture of a lecture board or binder paper to stills of people you never thought you could miss in settings you never thought you d become attached to and private snapshots of the idiosyncrasies of college life most take for granted but you thought you d never experience p p And then the next time some nostalgic middle aged mom tells you those were the best four years of your life you won t at all mind p div div div Wed 02 May 2018 03 36 00 0000 Karthik

field item even property content encoded p strong Thoughts on Last Blog Post strong p p It feels weird to consider this my last blog post for the semester if not for the rest of my college career Unfortunately I will not be a blogger for the following year due to many circumstances and though it is abrupt and sad I do not consider it as a bad thing Rather I d like to consider it an opportunity to share one last constructed ramble of life lessons and expressive reflection before I head off to whatever the future has in store I hope you enjoy p p strong Reflection strong p p This past year I ve learned many things in how to live in life in no particular order commitments priorities value of friendship promises humility downfall of pride journalling entrepreneurship importance of timing serving maturity clear communication mental health strong community and physical activity Additionally cooking getting enough sleep freelancing creating good habits being imperfect being genuine rather than nice learning to say no running a business loving others in an organization stewarding time well learning to learn and many more lessons lay scattered in my mind p p Each word or phrase hits my mind with an overload of information A series of life events relate to the topic with some conclusions or lessons I ve gathered For the purpose of this blog post I ll share a few important things I ve learned and am still pursuing in learning p p strong 1 Journaling strong p p For my personality I find that many times when an important experience occurs I can t fully process my feelings and conclusions at the moment That s where I found the importance of journaling Taking a few mins every few hours or a chunk of time a day I write in a journal to hash out several questions I have What happened How did I feel about the experience What did I do well in that experience What are some things I ve learned What are some aspects I must improve on both for myself and others Through journaling I ve found it to be very enjoyable and fruitful because I ve gotten to learn a lot about who I am as a person It s helped me not only in understanding how I act in certain situations but also helped me in recognizing my weaknesses and improve my shortcomings p p strong 2 Creating healthy habits strong p p As an upcoming senior and soon graduating I find that there s going to be a lot of adulting that s going to happen and I can t help but be hesitant over what s to come I don t want my life to be wasted away on things of trivial importance or poor life choices One day I hope to have many responsibilities like a job and my own family and I know I will be held accountable for these important obligations With this I recognize that many of the habits that I m building up right now will influence how I live in the future If I don t learn to be structural in certain aspects of my life these habits will become increasingly harder to incorporate into my life and I will be more likely to compromise important commitments Whether it s simple things like exercising more eating 3 meals a day or getting at least 8 hours of sleep a night I hope to incorporate healthy habits so that I can do my best not only for myself but also for others p p strong 3 Learning to Say No strong p p I love doing stuff for people because I am inherently a people pleaser Nothing makes me happier than the approval that others give me because of something I ve done for them But with this attitude comes a curse There is a limit to what I can do for others and I find myself overcommitting to too many things organizations entrepreneurship volunteer services in the church or even relationships with other people Although I find value in these things my concentration and scope of ability are stretched too thin when I try to take on too many commitments all at once Because of this I often don t follow through on my obligations and I fail to give my fullest sometimes hurting people through the process It s important for me to recognize what I can do and learn to genuinely say no when it s really too much for me p p strong 4 Maturity strong p p There are many times in life when I want to give up act irresponsibly like a little child or be selfish and simply stop caring However I know that I am living immaturely if I decide to do that Being mature is a blanket statement that covers a lot of things Admitting mistakes taking on a job that no one else may want to do gritting your teeth and following a conviction clearly communicating and being genuine with how you feel even if it may hurt someone else There are so many other aspects on maturity that I m learning and still figuring out but I believe that many different aspects of maturity will be revealed as time goes on and I ll become better at living out a mature lifestyle p p strong 5 Learning to Learn strong p p I believe that education does not end after graduation but it is a task to live out every day College is only one season in life for learning only one form where knowledge and wisdom can come from I find that I ve learned more things outside of college through the organizations and ventures that I ve pursued after sales and hustling as a GCP ambassador networking and pitching through Entrepreneurship and working in a team and doing management through hackathons I m still learning how to learn but putting that as a higher priority is something I want to focus on in the coming years p p strong 6 Being Imperfect strong p p In the end I am not a perfect person It s important to accept the fact that I cannot know everything This acknowledgment is not an excuse to be lazy or not aware but rather a comfort and a reminder that there s grace in a lot of things that I do allowing me to push forward to what the future has in store p p strong 7 Community strong p p em If you want to run fast run alone if you want to run far run together em p p an African proverb p p strong Final Farewell strong p p As a closing statement for this blog post and blog whether you re a first time reader or have been reading these posts since the beginning I hope that you have been able to take away something meaningful from what I ve been writing Whether it s a small fact about Python a funny story about hackathons an intentional way to deal with recruiting or another way to reflect and look on life everything I ve written was in the hope that you would learn and pursue things with an intentional mind and heart p p em As always thanks for reading I ve been really blessed to have had this

items div class field item even property content encoded p This will be one of my last blog posts for the UT Computer Science blog so I decided to use it to talk about something that I don t see acknowledged much in the computer science department mental health Especially as we approach finals week we as students tend to ignore mental health Grades we tell ourselves are more important than whatever emotional or mental strife we might be experiencing Just stay up as late as you have to work as hard as you have to push through the deep seated anxiety and discomfort you might be feeling until the semester finally ends and you can finally let yourself feel But what happens when the end of the semester doesn t bring you the relief that you re expecting p p As you could probably tell from the majority of my blog posts this school year has been very hard for me and I m finally ready to talk about it in hopes that I can stop even one more person from making the mistakes that I made Here s the story of this school year starting with last semester p p When the school year started I knew that Operating Systems was going to be hard I took the least number of hours I possibly could although in retrospect I should have balanced my coursework a little better across the disciplines At the time I saw no problem with it I thought that no matter how hard the semester was going to be I could handle it I was very quickly proven wrong as career fair interviews and building a heap for Operating Systems overwhelmed me in the span of a week I got 3 hours of sleep before career fair and then I talked to recruiters from 8am to 5pm I almost broke down crying in front of the GE recruiter for no apparent reason But it was fine I thought Once I got some sleep my mind would rebalance and I d keep powering ahead p p Only I didn t get sleep not immediately I stayed up late two more nights trying to finish my OS project before the deadline Spoiler I didn t finish it It was the first time I d failed so spectacularly Knowing I probably wasn t going to get even half credit for my submission I finally gave up and went to sleep That weekend I was hit by what I thought to be a sickness complete with fever and allergy like symptoms I wrote a href https www cs utexas edu blog you come first this blog post a thinking that I had learned my lesson and that everything would be better once I got some rest and recovered from my sickness I started trying to a href https www cs utexas edu blog how much too much change my mindset a so that I wouldn t be as stressed about my mounting failures I started to feel nauseous and tired every evening like clockwork I thought it was because I wasn t getting enough sleep or because I was still sick or well I don t know em what em I thought was going on but I chose to ignore it I chose to believe that things were getting better even though I was still exhausted every day no matter how much sleep I got I no longer had the energy to be happy p p Then Hack TX happened at the end of October I didn t make the connection that maybe losing sleep when I was already struggling was not a great idea I went to Hack TX but I was uneasy the whole day I had started the day off pretty tired and I never did recover from that Some combination of the food and the environment made me nauseous and I was unable to focus very well I had a meltdown around twelve hours in the kind where you find a private corner of the Omni hotel that nobody else is in and just cry and cry until one of your friends finds you and calms you down I don t remember much else from that night aside from trying to get some sleep in hopes that it would rebalance my emotions I was still convinced that my mental state was temporary p p If you ask me about what happened in the month of November I wouldn t be able to tell you much because frankly I don t remember I don t remember how I felt I don t remember what happened I think that maybe I started going to counseling after the Hack TX incident because my roommate forced me to I also think the nausea started to pick up along with random nights of sneezing and allergy like symptoms I vaguely remember the constant feeling of wanting to die wanting to go to sleep and never wake up I remember that things were bad but I don t remember how bad Maybe my mind is trying to protect itself by repressing those memories I don t know I still have poems from that time but even as I read them I can t quite recall that overwhelming feeling of dread and defeat I remember wanting to hurt myself on occasion but never doing it because I knew that someone would find out I got through November purely because Thanksgiving Break was on the horizon and I was convinced that it would magically make me feel better and solve all my problems p p As you can imagine that didn t happen The Monday before school resumed I had a doctor s appointment It was just your average yearly checkup but my doctor made me take a few questionnaires to check on my mental health I was diagnosed with depression but it was a relatively minor case I was convinced that I wasn t em that em depressed and I didn t need medication because the semester was almost over I could make it through and then a month long break from school would help me recuperate I declined to go on medication and I forgot to tell anyone that I d been diagnosed p p One good thing about the diagnosis was that I no longer felt guilty for feeling the way I felt I knew I was suicidal because of a chemical imbalance in my brain and that helped rationalize it to some extent It also helped me connect the dots a bit The constant nausea was a result of anxiety The allergy like symptoms were a result of stress I realized that I only ever felt nauseous if I was working on OS homework I decided that I was not going to sink my time into a class that was making me physically ill and I started spending less and less time on OS I spent more and more time sleeping and the physiological effects of my depression got worse It was harder to get out of bed and it was harder to motivate myself to do things Nothing was enjoyable anymore p p If you thought my memories of November were shaky my memories of December are even worse I can t remember a single thing about how I felt in December It s like one giant hole in my memory I had a play the first weekend of December and I distinctly remember that on the day after my third performance I was trying to go to sleep when I suddenly couldn t breathe or talk or even reach for my phone to ask for help The feeling passed after a few seconds but I went to sleep crying that night and I woke up crying the next morning I cried for that whole day even after my parents picked me up and ate breakfast with me even after I talked to my roommate even as I talked to my other friends My mother forced me to call my doctor and get medications for depression In case you didn t know depression medications take 2 4 weeks to actually go into effect so I didn t feel any better In fact I probably felt worse Any time I tried to hang out with my friends and relax I panicked Any time I tried to work on OS by myself I felt so nauseous that I wanted to throw up or I panicked I talked to my OS teacher on the last day of classes about how I didn t think I would be able to take the exam without having a panic attack and he was surprisingly understanding and willing to make accomodations for me He told me that I should take full advantage of what the school had to offer to help with mental health p p Things didn t immediately get better once the semester was over I had one relapse during a family vacation the next week and I randomly started crying during a family reunion the following week It wasn t until I got back to school actually that I was beginning to feel a little better I d finally gotten on the right dose of medication and over the course of the next semester I would take the necessary steps to make sure that I didn t fall back into the depths of depression I m not 100 okay now I m definitely doing better I actually remember what happiness feels like for one thing and this semester has gone better as a whole I recognize now that if I m feeling nauseous about something it s connected to my anxiety I ve been routinely seeing a counselor so that I can work through the unhealthy mindsets I ve cultivated over the years and get myself to a better place My friends and family have been supportive of me and I m very thankful for that p p But I know there are people out there who don t have the same supportive network of family and friends or who aren t going to be forced into counseling like I was or who aren t going to coincidentally end up at the doctor s office

boots I like to imagine he was chewing a piece of straw or a toothpick his horse parked outside spittoon hidden in his carry on p p At my Northern Californian high school no one ventured out to Texas for college No one really even knew what Texas was like Our views shaped solely by television stereotypes my friends expected me to come back in overalls having traded my guitar in for a banjo and having switched majors from computer science to cattle herding The teasing didn t faze me though because I after reading tons of forums online about how liberal UT was and how hippie Austin was fully expected to be met at the airport with a drum circle Green Party bumper stickers and celebratory beads That is up until that howdy which fazed the hell out of me p p My thoughts then went from em I wonder who I ll meet at orientation what classes I ll end up taking what Jester will be like to Oh god am I going to look out of place for not dressing like Woody from Toy Story I should ve listened to my friends and packed some dip in my suitcase em p p Thankfully the first few minutes of orientation showed me that UT wasn t the set of a Western but this surreal experience was the first in a long line of shattered expectations and for someone who anxiously over plans takes forever to adapt and daydreams future days to the littlest of details this unpreparedness terrified me p p The first unexpected problem was my nearly non existent ability to befriend strangers The fact that 80 of these strangers were from Texas didn t help They strolled in decked out in burnt orange already knowing the Eyes of Texas which organizations to join and where to live Many came from popular high schools and for them campus was already populated with friendly faces and the sea of grey New Balances and Wranglers and Nike shorts and oversized t shirts were no surprise That isn t to say people weren t warm they were mostly great but being even more awkward and gangly than I am now I found it impossible to connect with these people who seemed so different than me who I haven t been influenced by and influencing and learning to get along with for the last twelve years this same fact not stopping them from meshing with each other so well like nothing had changed amplifying my own strangeness p p As the semester went on they clustered into groups while I watched my face pressed against these impermeable bubbles trying to peer in for a hint as to what I was doing wrong My loneliness grew It grew as I thought back to high school as those in the grade above us returned from college like Cabeza De Vaca with crazy stories and promises of life skyrocketing in quality and I went to sleep fantasizing about this upcoming golden chapter of life It grew as I went home after finals and my parents friends with a nauseating enthusiasm said things like So em how s college em Isn t it amazing I m SO jealous I wish I could go back Really the best four years of your life Savor it and I briefly thought back to my last Friday night when I sat on my stained blue mattress continuously refreshing Messenger hoping my lack of responses was a symptom of WiFi issues and not some sad secret I d never understand eating unhealthy amounts of Gummy Vites scrolling through Snapchat addicted to what I was missing out on before reciprocating their ear to ear smile and regurgitating the three fun things I did in the last three months so as to not be a downer p p The feeling only slightly relented over winter break when I returned to my expectation less hometown to the love of my parents and to friends I truly valued rediscovering all of my incredible privileges and blessings I hid this feeling of relief as my friends like those in the year before us enamored with their new lives pined to go back p p I persisted in my efforts to find my people making conversation with strangers in dining halls while trying to mask my desperation only to have the acquaintanceships fizzle out due to their contrived beginnings I played board games and withstood lame icebreakers at club meetings leaving just as anonymously as I entered learning nothing about the people I had just interacted with for an hour aside from Jenny being allergic to watermelon two truths one lie and Sam being an awful liar mafia If it weren t for the two friends I had coming into UT an incredible stroke of luck I could ve easily gone weeks without any substantial conversation p p And freshman year a time demanding rapid adaptation was an awful time to be depressed In the background of my futile searches for promised connections I was getting wrecked by interviews which made me question my intelligence wrecked by my introductory computer science classes which made me question my major my future and again my intelligence and wrecked by Introduction to U S History which made me question my life in general I lost motivation to attend class followed by motivation to be awake during normal societal hours I stopped going to the only class I enjoyed Intro to Philosophy since it didn t agree with my 6am 2pm but get out of bed at 4pm sleep schedule p p I wrote off the next three years as a waste restlessly

The entrance is this small gaping hole that leads on a seemingly endless trail that has no end There is also a phrase that is associated with it called Going Down the Rabbit Hole In reference to Alice s Adventures in Wonderland the main character Alice curiously chases after a well dressed rabbit with a giant watch into a rabbit hole in order to appease her curiosity leading to a series of adventures that are described in the book p p These past few weeks I ve gone down a few of my own rabbit holes Usually my computer wandering leads me to the realm of gameplay on Youtube for Fortnite or I end up reading several articles from HackerNewsLetter or The Hustle but recently I ve tried to be a bit more explorative with the things I m learning p p Last week I got to learn about mental models They are tools in a toolbox in order to map out understand the world Mental models are pretty fascinating because they are almost fundamental truths on how to intake information and react to events in life One mental model I m still trying to wrap my brain around is a href https jamesclear com inversion inversion a The idea revolves around thinking about the negative things that could happen and avoiding those outcomes Rather than focusing on how to achieve success inversion focuses on managing failure I find inversion hard to follow because many times I enjoy acting more on impulse rather than through reflection and careful calculation If you d like to go down the rabbit hole of mental models I suggest reading this a href https www fs blog mental models blog a p p Just today I ve learned about civil engineering Someone I knew got a job to be a staff engineer right in Chicago for a civil engineering company and I got a glimpse of what it s like to be a civil engineer and hear on the importance of it for society Did you know that there is a crazy complexity behind working with construction on highways vs construction on local roads The reason is not only because construction on highways can impact the travel in many surrounding areas but also because there is so much designing and planning civil engineers need to do before executing construction Rather than thinking short term civil engineers have to consider long term in many sectors travel economy the environment and many more The challenge is to create a resilient design that won t need to be changed for hundreds if not thousands of years because it fits seamlessly well into the society even through change p p As you can tell these rabbit holes I ve gone down are pretty random Mental models may influence how I live daily but civil engineering may never touch my life ever again p p I believe though that by intentionally going down the rabbit hole it can help fuel learning and allow for a greater appreciation of life Sure it s important to allocate time in order to focus on schoolwork and get the current job done But having moments set aside in order to be open to learning new things and exploring areas that have never been explored before can refresh your mind from the mundane tasks of every day and allow for a more productive mind when you have to go back to the things you do daily in life p p em Greetings y all thanks for reading this blog post The year is almost over and this is considered the busiest time of the semester Keep on pushing through though and before you

influences their emotions Most people reciprocate the question and so I want to be prepared with the best possible answer utilizing the the journal I ve kept for the last 4ish years p p Thankfully high school Karthik had the foresight to a collection of plain text files one for each day rather than an array of fancy Moleskines so I was able to write a a href https gist github com heems

further inspection some semesters were definitely mis ranked Winter 2014 for example was a wholly unexceptional period of my life and shouldn t have had the worst sentiment p p I sorted the entries by sentiment and did someone manual investigation There were a lot of issues p p I had one entry that just consisted of this strange run on tried to install mopidy soundcloud and then just started admiring fonts and code quality in this random library and now im trying to change my font that had a sentiment of 0 5 on a 1 to 1 scale one of the lowest detected I m not sure if TextBlob isn t a very good library if ranking my style of speech is an unsolved problem or if sentiment analysis in general doesn t work well in these kinds of situations Intro to Data Mining hadn t prepared me for this p p I also realized that 80 of my entries were either heavily sarcastic or ridden with slang both situations that TextBlob or most easy to use NLP libraries couldn t handle understandably Last night was so lit returned a sentiment of 0 which neutralized half of my happy entries while this is hopeless lmao returned a significantly positive sentiment of 0 6 p p Failed by my optimism in cut and paste machine learning solutions I regressed to entering the sentiment of each day by hand In the future I might ask someone smarter than me for help tuning an existing NLP model with all of this newly created training data p p While I was originally put off by the task feeling like a Mechanical Turker it was a lot of fun going back through my life putting myself in old shoes and retrospectively rating days from these past perspectives More exciting were the results a mostly accurate result to my original question p p a href https imgur com nvD3qRq GRAPH 2 a p p I ll talk

vs month p p a href https imgur com UrfWzT4 GRAPH 3 a p p There s a significant spike in June On further investigation I found that these entries all tried to capture whatever new city I was in for whatever internship I was at demanding a lot of words It was a lot of complaining about my intern projects p p Next I tried to find a correlation between entry length frequency and sentiment looking to answer the question em do I write more when I m happy or sad em There was a weak negative correlation between entry frequency and sentiment meaning I journal more to vent rant than to celebrate which might skew the scores but wouldn t change the relative rankings p p Finally I created a wordcloud for the bottom 100 entries by sentiment and one for the top 100 entries by sentiment to see the common influencers of my emotions The findings were accurate and funny but much too explicit for this blog I ll show you if you ask p div div div Wed 18 Apr 2018 05 10 55 0000 Karthik Bala 72018 at

Exercise is one of the most important things to incorporate into a lifestyle After experiencing all nighters in the GDC eating snacks and sitting hunchbacked in front of a computer creds to 439 and Graphics I realized that my physical health was important to sustain in order to succeed in other areas in my life p p In fact health was something I tried to take account of every semester I was in college As someone who is horrible at doing things consistently without structure especially with limited time I signed up for college Physical Education classes PED in order to incorporate exercise into my life p p The first few semesters of college I occupied myself with Social dance both Beginner and Intermediate I found Social dance to be one of the most fun classes I ve taken besides Interpersonal Communication Theory and Fiction Writing Every Tuesday and Thursday at 3 PM I would go down to the Stadium to learn how to Waltz around the room Bachata my way through hip movements and West Coast Swing over any song is given I may not have been the best but it was a fun class not only to meet many people but also share a conversation that went beyond talking p p Even now I keep up with some of the social dance people from time to time and every time we cross paths on campus though we don t talk together we share a smile because somehow dancing connects people on a deeper level more than many other social events p p Unfortunately social dance took up a huge chunk of time and as much as I loved it I realized I couldn t keep up with all the shenanigans With this I turned towards running This was an adventurous point in my academic career p p At a time when structure and control were super important directly after Operating Systems I desired to have early morning classes that would force me to sleep early and set me straight for the rest of the days Taking Beginning Running took me to 8AMs on Mondays and Wednesdays regularly and this was when I learned tha2t I wasn t an early morning person p p Though I got to build up a running pace from 9 30 to 8 30 mins per mile I started sleeping less and more irregularly and I ended up not wanting to make it to class due to my exhaustion and lack of energy stamina p p So in my 3rd year 1st semester I decided that I needed to cut back on stamina and start building up muscle I had focused on gains during my high school time but fell out of it after entering college This was the time that I built up a lot of gluts but probably injured my body the most Taking Weight Training I gained insight over how to properly train the muscles but what ended up happening was after I finished the class I didn t want to take another class for physical education p p It was then this semester that I decided to take my health into my own hands Considering that I will be graduating within the next year I knew that there would no longer be a class that would force me to exercise Additionally I didn t want to be dependent on having a class in order to take care of my health p p Because of it with greater blocks of time laid out I ve tried to schedule out my own time for exercise and I ve come to fall in love with basketball Though it was a sport that had its shortcomings and I felt very out of place playing it in my middle high school years I found it to be an amazing sports pastime not only to build up stamina but also meet an amazing community p p Whether you re a freshman in college or a senior getting to graduate I d say that you can start exercising at any point in time It can take as little as 30 mins of your day to incorporate a routine to stay fit Sure it takes a bit of time to measure out your schedule and you may have to rearrange some of the things that you re committed to in life but being able to stay healthy through exercise will prepare you for a lifetime of benefits p p em Greetings y all Thanks for reading my blog post this week These past two weeks have been a struggle bus of ups and downs whether it s being too busy to find time to do projects going to baptism Sunday or having some real talks with people Though things may not be steady I ve been fortunate to learn a

field items div class field item even property content encoded p As some of you know I do theater in my free time This semester I was an actor in a production of em Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead em and we performed two weekends ago Theater and computer science are completely different in how they work but both disciplines can learn something from each other I ve always stood at the intersection of the two struggling to mold myself to fit the wildly different criteria required for each I ve always focused on how my two loves are different and how participating in both gives me a varied skill set and a different set of experiences A couple weeks ago though I started thinking about how the two fields might be similar p p Now for those of you who don t know anything about theater the week leading up to opening night is called tech week by amateurs and hell week by those who have experienced it before I have no idea em why em rehearsals are always structured this way inavailability of the performing space maybe but to me it has always felt like the ultimate form of procrastination You see most shows don t require you to have your lines memorized until tech week or some time close to it and as the name suggests no technical components of the show costumes props lights sound set and so on are added until tech week In the course of a week you go from practicing your play in your regular clothes in a small classroom to performing in a large space with a backstage area and costume changes and props that you ve never thought about before p p As an analogy imagine that you have a class where you spend the whole semester working on one very large group project Like any reasonable computer science student you put it off until the very last minute and then you panic and try to do the whole project in a week with only a rough idea of what you re doing To add to your problems you re only allowed to handwrite your code on paper up until the very last week when you can finally use a computer an IDE and a debugger Wouldn t that be ridiculous You d be spending hours and hours during that last week debugging your code because you d be running into problems you never could have anticipated and you d be too tired to think through any problems you encountered You might be able to put together something that would work for the project but you certainly would have created a more impressive product if you d spent the whole semester working on the project bit by bit incrementally testing your code and integrating the different parts p p Theater is the same way Even though we end up doing everything at the end I think plays would be less stressful and come together better if we incrementally added components You start off with just the lines the words on the paper and your actors Then after the actors know the words well enough you add in movements entrances and exits and another layer of emotion Once the actors are familiar with their lines and movements you add in a few technical components perhaps just the props and the simple costumes And finally once you have the performance space available you can add in the lights sound set and costume changes in full The last week would still be stressful of course but it wouldn t be as bad as trying to add everything in all at once and running into all sorts of problems when things don t work well together It s like having every member of your group write code separately and then merging it all together on the last day Just imagine how many merge conflicts you d encounter and how much functionality would break p p I think actors and theater in general could learn a lot from computer science when it comes to implementing an incremental process At the same time computer scientists could learn a lot from the theater There s a certain polished aspect to a performance that is forged through the sweat and tears of a week of really hard work It s painful and stressful and long but by the end you ve put together something you care about and are proud of and you didn t just do it for the audience you did it for you The actors the technicians the directors everyone involved in a production pours their feeling into that final product I think when it comes to computer science we re very often just doing what we can for the sake of doing it not always because we care We often fall into this pattern of creating products because we re told to pushing the boundaries of research simply because we can and our work can lose that personal touch Yet there was some passion some driving force that got us working on that project or that team in the first place and we should remember that and incorporate that passion into our work not just in how quickly we work but how em well em we work A final product created by loving hands is far better than one created by impersonal code monkeys p p At the end of the day I m still going to have to keep stretching to be the ideal performer and the ideal programmer at the same time But perhaps if I can focus on the ways that one field is honing my skills for the other I won t have to stretch quite as hard When it comes down to it theater and computer science are simply different expressions of humanity different avenues through which the beauty of thought and feeling are presented Perhaps theater is more poetic and computer science is more practical but they both have their uses for me and for the world p div div div Thu 05 Apr 2018 20 52 45 0000 Mayuri Raja 71990 at https www cs utexas edu https www cs utexas edu blog

crisis on a weekly to bi weekly basis The crises range from the standard em is my major right for me em to the more extreme em is college even the right path for me would I be happier opening a bagel stand in the Pacific Northwest or maybe shaving my head selling my possessions and moving to the Himalayas to become one with the universe em I suffer from a severe case of The Grass Is Always Greener Syndrome and the discontented restlessness it produces leads to many improbable daydreams and fantasies about alternate life paths p p The theme of my latest episode thankfully much milder than wanting to move to Hawaii to pursue hula dancing was career regret I imagined myself happier in a business y role a consulting or operations or analyst job or something of the sort and kicked myself for never exploring other options in the precious four years when it s easiest to I felt that I had pigeonholed myself into tech and would spend the rest of my life positioning divs while numbing the pain with kombucha and expensive headphones instead of shmoozing clients in Belize or watching millions of dollars fly across eight different monitors on a trading floor full of grunts and whoops and Wes Walker playing in the background If I did want to switch if I re negged and tried to finesse some business job that required little to no qualifications and ever so slowly worked my way up to some bargain bin Jordan Belfort wannabe I d be behind my business friends who ve been snaking networking and resume padding for the last four years p p I decided to mention my worry to my parents more so to change the subject from what I was eating or when I was sleeping than to solicit advice Most of the advice my parents give me has no correlation to the problem at hand It s like they pick slips out of a hat of aphorisms of widely varying practicality such as drink more water chewing your food thoroughly is essential for the body and mind or meditate until you realize that everything is one and at that point even your biggest worries will be rendered trivial As a consequence of this I often forget that they ve lived for fifty plus years and that I share half of their DNA p p After some of the accurate but difficult to internalize cliches such as you shouldn t compare yourself to anybody but yourself do what makes you happy not what looks the best my dad dropped some truly impactful advice the kind of advice you get from a self help book that starts with a case study on an individual who followed it so you know the claim is substantiated in some way He listed off his college friends all in their 50s now all super successful in their own ways and how they got there p p The best engineer he knew is now a spiritual consultant who writes abstract blog posts and barely uses technology Another friend of his worked on electronics for 15 years before deciding to go to business school in his late 30s and is now a consultant in a field that has absolutely nothing to do with his education or work experience In fact most of his friends even the ones that seemed 100 set on further pursuing what they studied bounced around from career to career well into adulthood and they were happier because of it thoroughly exploring each pasture to ensure that when they settled on a side the grass wasn t greener on the other p p It s ridiculous to get hung up on finding your life passion in the first quarter of your life and force yourself to commit to it for the other three You have no idea how you re going to evolve or how the people you re comparing yourself to are going to evolve You can loosely model the trajectory of your life with some dumb college life regression that takes in GPA gregariousness and internship prestige but humans are infinitely more complex than that Four years is nothing in the grand scheme of life and despite all my best efforts and over planning forty year old Karthik might want to throw away 20 years of programming experience to teach senior citizens diaphragmatic breathing and there s nothing I can do to stop him so there s no point in stressing about where I ll fall in my misguided success graph this far in advance p p My dad didn t tell me to switch majors or put my blinders on and force myself to enjoy the job I had lined up but to calm down and treat each phase of life as a necessary learning experience that d get me

thefreejournalist gmail com About Me Hello My name is Angela Cao I am currently a senior attending The University of Texas at Austin I am double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics and pursuing a certificate in Scientific Computations and Data Sciences I might also pursue Computational Science and Engineering Certificate Program alongside as well My interest in mathematics was nurtured through academic competitions in and out of class since elementary school where I won a lot of awards a regional competitor in junior year of high school and taking math classes several grades ahead through the talented and gifted program of my school My interest in computer science was nurtured through doing programming and Computer Science modules through Khan Academy taking a few Computer Science courses in my high school and participating in a Girls Who Code Summer Immersion program Although college is definitely not easy in terms of academic difficulty at all and I faced a lot of obstacles that were sometimes tempting to quit these certain interests and move on to a possibly easier but less rewarding interest my interests in both mathematics and computer science nurtured on more there and not only did my college experience helped me become a better computer scientist and mathematician but also a better person as well As a person I am inquisitive knowledge hungry hardworking dedicated ambitious goal and achievement oriented work oriented determined analytical resourceful and perfectionistic While these certain character traits have helped me be where I am at today they also have their own setbacks as well as my college experience has shown as well However the obstacles that I have faced throughout my college experience have shaped me not only to be a better person but the person that I am today as well Aside from taking classes in UT Austin throughout my college experience I have participated in research both in and out of class In my freshman year of college I participated in FRI Freshman Research Initiative through the Autonomous Intelligent Robots stream In my sophomore year of college I took a Computer Architecture research class and assisted with a graduate student with his own neural networks research for a short time In junior year of college I participated in the Directed Reading Program DRP under the UT Mathematics department as I was finally an official mathematics major and done two research projects under the guidance of several graduate students and so far is the most successful research experience that I have done so far Thus I will participate in Directed Reading Program DRP again in my senior and last year of college and planning to take several independent studies research classes as well as part of completing my certificate s as well I am also an active member of the UT Austin Association for Women in Mathematics as well Not only do I plan on graduating from UT Austin with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics and a certificate or two most likely Scientific Computation and Data Sciences and maybe also Computational Sciences and Engineering but I also plan to work in the tech industry as a software engineer developer most likely in the front end or Data Scientist first and getting a masters in Applied Mathematics most likely or Data Science as Applied Mathematics has been my most preferred field in the recent years or so As a side job I also plan to do freelance writing journalism on the sideline as well as writing and expressing or the exchange of ideas through debate have

Entry Level until they complete the requirements to be promoted into the Upper Division Sequence Promotion Requirements 2 75 Entry level GPA Entry Level Classes CS 312 CS 311 CS 314 Miscellaneous Complete all CS Entry Level sequence courses with no grade lower than a C Complete all CS Entry Level courses in no more than 2 attempts dropped courses including Q drops and Withdrawls count as an attempt Maintain UT GPA of 2 0 The Upper Division Sequence describes the set of courses normally taken in the last three years of undergraduate study in which students put to use the tools and concepts learned in Entry Level courses Student s records will be reviewed following the posting of grades at the conclusion of summer and after each long semester Students who meet the requirements for promotion will be automatically promoted into the major Please note University policy states that you may NOT for any reason retake a course if you have made a C or better That is true of our Entry level courses as well In calculating your entry level GPA for promotion purposes if you make below a C in an Entry level course and must retake it you have one additional attempt we will only use the best of your attempts at each class Keep in mind that all attempts will be used in calculating your official UT GPA I didn t get promoted now what If you fail to meet the CS entry level GPA requirement and you are ineligible to repeat an entry level course your admission to UTCS will be denied and your major will be changed to CNS Undeclared The Department of Computer Science takes the success of their students very seriously The faculty made the decision for the entry level GPA based on the analysis of data regarding the success rate of students in our program and these requirements will be strictly enforced If you wish to appeal this decision instructions will be provided to you through a Secure Academic Note SAN once all promotions have been completed You will be notified of the outcome of your appeal within the first 12 class days of the semester Here are some important things to remember 1 You must have an extenuating circumstance to appeal For example a medical issue or something similar that had a negative impact on your GPA This issue will need to be documented by a physician or a nonacademic counselor 2 If your appeal is approved the department will assist you with adding CS courses on or after the FOURTH day of classes FAQ category CS Entry Level Promotion 2317 Speedway Stop D9500 Austin TX 78712 Phone 512 471 7316 The University of Texas

Database useful It is a searchable database in which one may look up the UT equivalent for any college course offered within the state of Texas Keep in mind that the University imposes a residency requirement In order to receive an undergraduate degree you must complete 60 hours in residence at UT Austin CS readiness CNS information for incoming students Question What type of computer should I buy We get this question often from prospective students so we asked our ambassadors experienced CS students to answer As far as computers go every CS student has access to the computers in the 3rd floor and basement labs of the Bill and Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex for their programming and general purpose needs as well as the computers around campus in the libraries and other computer labs for general purpose use The computer labs in Gates are open 24 7 for student use Therefore the type of computer that you should buy in preparation for coming to college should be one that you are comfortable using There is no departmental preference between Windows Mac Unix or Chrome operating systems In terms of hardware few classes will actually stress your computer to the point where processors overheating becomes an issue and for CS classes that require a lot of computing power for simulations or graphics most students use the computers in the labs Most computer science classes do not allow students to take notes on laptops during class so laptop use in class would likely only be for non CS courses and would probably consist of note taking For example a student recalls using a laptop with a processor that was 2 or 3 steps behind the i3 as well as one with an i3 processor and had no laptop related problems While having a laptop in college is not a requirement I definitely recommend that students bring one just in case they need to use a computer while in their dorm room As for the type of computer the best short answer that I can give is for you to bring the laptop that you are most comfortable using because you won t have to do anything on your personal computer remotely that you wouldn t be able to do on a lab computer besides take notes in class It is definitely common for students to have basic laptops for general purpose use For example a student might primarily use their laptop for note taking and occasionally remote accessing to one of the CS machines at UT to do programming If a student requires the use of a certain software or needs to be on the network and etc they typically choose to work in the labs There are students who have more advanced laptops and even desktops but it s definitely not required and most people use these more advanced systems for personal use such as gaming not because it s a requirement of the major This is why we suggest prospective students to buy whatever laptop they feel comfortable working on and has the capability to do what they would want to do outside of class Undergraduate AdmissionsProspective

guarantee a seat but will wait for one to open up Want to manage a waitlist Yes I m an administrator Yes and I m an adviser Administrators who can make changes to closing limits can manage department waitlists Questions about lists How does a waitlist work Prior to waitlists when a closed class reopened students could only get into the class if they were lucky enough to register at the moment the seats opened up and only during their access period By contrast as students drop classes the waitlist system fills those seats automatically with students on its waitlist and can do this outside of student access periods When are waitlists available For administrators the system is activated when the RC screen turns on a few weeks before registration begins For students and instructors lists are active from the start of registration through the fourth class day second class day in summer if they ve been turned on by the department After the fourth second day students need approval to add a class How do I get to my department s waitlists Administrators can get to their lists through UT Direct Academic Services UT Registrar Waitlist System where they can choose lists from any department which grants them RC access What can staff do with waitlists You can see lists turn lists on and off remove students email a list roster track activity on and changes to a list and track a student s

classes Why should I turn a list on or off A list isn t available to students unless it is on You can turn a list on any time after the RC screen for its class becomes available Turn a list on if your department wants a list offered for registration Turn a list off if your department manipulates seatcounts to manage enrollment during orientation or in FIGs since opening seats will add students from the list instead of the intended group Such lists can be turned on again later after enrollment commitments have been addressed While on a list ranks students in the order they joined the list If a seat opens in the class it is filled by the first qualified student on the list While off registration is suspended until the list is turned back on or until all students are removed from the list When a list without students is turned off registration acts normally an opened seat is filled with whomever registers next Can I work with lists on the mainframe No While you can see waitlist information on your RC screen you can only work with them in UT Direct Can I still put a student directly into a class Yes You can put a student in a class with a PF1 override in NRTTVR They will be dropped from the waitlist if they had joined it before the override Why won t anything happen to a class after I increase its seatcount The seats won t fill up right away because waitlisting changes group seatcounts overnight Check the class tomorrow morning Why can t I see all my depts in the waitlist system pulldown menu The pulldown shows all of your authorized depts If one does not appear

offered in three equivalent sequences at UT an accelerated two semester sequence M 408C D and two three semester sequences M 408K L M and M 408N S M The latter is restricted to students in the College of Natural Sciences Completion with grades of C or better of one of these calculus sequences is required for a mathematics major For some degrees the two semester sequence M 408N S satisfies the calculus requirement These two courses are also a valid prerequisite for some upper division mathematics courses including M 325K 427K 340L and 362K M 408N may not be counted by students with credit for any of Mathematics 403K 408K 408C or 408L Course description M 408N is the first semester calculus course of the three course calculus sequence It is directed at students in the natural sciences and is restricted to College of Natural Science Students The emphasis in this course is on problem solving not on the presentation of theoretical considerations While the course includes some discussion of theoretical notions these are supporting rather than primary The syllabus for M 408N includes most of the basic topics in the theory of differential calculus of functions of a real variable algebraic trigonometric logarithmic and exponential functions and their limits continuity derivatives maxima and minima as well as definite integrals and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Overview and Course Goals The following pages comprise the syllabus for M 408N and advice on teaching it Calculus is a service course and the material in it was chosen after interdepartmental discussions Please cover the material that is not deemed optional You will do your students a disservice and leave them ill equipped for subsequent courses This is not a course in the theory of calculus the majority of the proofs in the text should not be covered in class At the other extreme some of our brightest math majors found their first passion in calculus one ought not to bore them Remember that 408N S M is the sequence designed for students who may not have taken calculus previously Students who have seen calculus and have done well might be better placed in the faster M 408C 408D sequence Resources for Students Many students find the study skills from high school are not sufficient for UT The Sanger Learning Center http lifelearning utexas edu in Jester has a wide variety of material drills video taped lectures computer programs counseling math anxiety workshops algebra and trig review calculus review as well as tutoring options all designed to help students through

408K 408N or 408L Course description M408C is the standard first semester calculus course It is directed at students in the natural sciences and engineering The emphasis in this course is on problem solving not the theory of analysis There should be some understanding of analysis but the majority of the proofs in the text should not be covered in class The syllabus for M408C includes most of the

chosen after interdepartmental discussions Please do not make drastic changes You will do your students a disservice and leave them ill equipped for subsequent courses For those instructors who have taught M408C previously some changes should be noted Chapter 7 has been moved to M408D allowing a slightly less hectic pace and more importantly the coverage of some topics which have been omitted or optional in the past The formal definition of a limit should be covered although you still shouldn t expect delta epsilon proofs Sections 3 8 3 9 3 10 4 7 are no longer optional Sections 6 3 6 4 6 5 have been included as optional sections and some but not all of these topics should be covered These adjustments give more attention to applications of both differentiation and integration Remember that 408C D is the fast sequence for students with good algebra skills students who cannot maintain the pace are encouraged to take either the 408NSM or the 408KLM sequence Resources for Students Many

time for testing and review Those teaching on TTh should adjust the syllabus a MWF lecture lasts 50 min a TTh 75 min The purpose of Chapter 6 is to provide applications showing students what

well on the advanced placement AP exams or are honors students or who have the approval of the faculty mathematics advisor Such sections and their restrictions are listed in the Course Schedule each semester Course description M 408C M 408D is our standard first year calculus sequence It is designed for students in the natural and social sciences and engineering students The emphasis in this course is on problem solving not on theory While the course necessarily includes some discussion of theoretical notions its primary objective is not the production of theorem provers M 408D contains a treatment of infinite series and an introduction to vectors and vector calculus in 2 space and 3 space including parametric equations partial derivatives gradients and multiple integrals Overview and Course Goals The following pages comprise the syllabus for M 408D and advice on teaching it Calculus is a service course and the material in it was chosen after interdepartmental discussions Please do

In general it is fair to say that M 408D students will do better than M 408C students on the other hand M 408D is a more difficult course Please keep in mind that students who pass this course meet the prerequisite for M 427K where it assumed they have good calculus skills The M 408C D sequence is the fast sequence for students with good algebra skills students who cannot maintain the pace are

upper division courses Students can apply for the certificate here This does not apply to students who are on the 2014 2016 or prior catalogs When should I attach the certificate As soon as possible Once you have applied for the certificate and been approved via SAN please contact your advisor and ask them to officially attach the certificate to your degree profile It must be attached and set to pursuing in order to gain access to the upper division Elements courses I applied for the certificate and my advisor says it s attached but it s not set to pursuing What do I do Email elements cs utexas edu with your name and EID and ask that your certificate be set to pursuing The certificate is attached and set to pursuing do I have priority for the Elements courses No you have access to register for or waitlist the upper division courses What if I am on the 2014 2016 or prior catalog Students following the 2014 2016 or prior catalogs do not have the function of having the certificate attached to their degree profile so please email elements cs utexas edu prior to registration in order to gain further instructions on how to access the Elements courses Can the certificate be made to Stand Alone No we will not make certificate Stand Alone they need to be attached to a degree profile and set to pursuing Am I required to take CS 303E or an approved equivalent Yes All students seeking the Elements certificate are required to take CS 303E or an approved equivalent Students who have AP credit for CS 312 may claim that course and it be counted towards the certificate Am I required to take CS 313E or an approved equivalent Students who are on the 2016 2018 catalog and beyond for their major and seeking the 18 hour certificate are required to take CS 313E or an approved equivalent If I have an approved equivalent for CS 303E and or CS 313E how will I be able to register for upper division Elements courses It is very likely that you will need a pre req waiver in this case Please email elements cs utexas edu provide your name EID which course is substituting for the pre req and which course you will like to be waived for We will respond to you ASAP once we ve created a pre req waiver and it is up to you to register for the course on your own A pre req waiver does not guarantee a spot in the course You will only be granted a pre req waiver for an APPROVED course substitution Here s an example of a pre req waiver request Name John Smith eID JH123 Substitution EE 312 for CS 303E Course s to be waived CS 324E and CS 327E Which upper division courses do not have CS 313E as a pre req As of the moment the CS 324E and 327E topics courses only require CS 303E as a pre req Many Elements courses require CS 313E as a pre req which is why it is highly recommended that students take the course prior to taking upper division Elements courses We will not waive pre reqs if students do not have an approved pre req course If I took CS 303E already does that mean I can no longer take CS 302 Correct CS 302 will not be an option once you have credit for CS 303E or an approved equivalent Additionally CS 302 will not count towards the Elements certificate if the course is taken after you ve received credit for CS 303E or an approved equivalent Students following the 2016 2018 and newer catalogs cannot use CS 302 towards the certificate When should I start taking courses for the Elements certificate In order to have the best chance at completing the Elements of Computing certificate by graduation students should take at least one Elements course each semester beginning in the sophomore year Elements courses have limited seating and students will not be given special priority when registering Students must have at least 50 of the certificate completed if they wish to complete any remaining coursework after graduation additionally students must complete all requirements and apply for certification within one academic year after graduation Are upper division Elements guaranteed by Senior Countdown Attaching the certificate to your degree profile DOES NOT change its status and is not considered a degree requirement and therefore is not guaranteed under Senior Countdown or any other similar program May I take any Elements courses pass fail No All Elements courses and any approved equivalents counting towards the Elements certificate will need to be taken for a letter grade You will need to receive a C or better in order for the course s to count towards the Elements certificate How many Elements courses are offered each semester Are you expecting to add more courses to the course schedule The number of Elements courses offered each semester varies It is highly possible that we are not expecting to add more courses to the course schedule however please check the course schedule periodically because any changes will reflect on the course schedule What is the max number of Elements upper division courses I can take in a semester Students have the opportunity to take a max of three Elements upper division courses in a semester this is highly unlikely though due to the demand of the courses Can I register for three Elements upper division courses during the initial registration period No I can only register for two Elements courses during the first registration period so when can I add a third course to my schedule Students have the potential to add or waitlist a third Elements course during the add drop period What does it mean if a course is Approved through a specified semester That means if you took the course on or prior to the listed semester it is an approved substitution for the Elements certificate regardless of when you apply for certification Taking the course past the semester will need approval from the Elements faculty advisor in order for it to be a valid substitution What if I would like to petition a non approved course substitution for the Elements certificate You must be registered for the course and have received or will be expecting to receive a C or better letter grade Please print read through follow all the instructions and fill out the Elements Course Substitution Form These petitions are not guaranteed for approval and you will be sent a SAN once the Elements faculty advisor makes a final decision The final decision may not be appealed How do I go about getting a transfer course evaluated as a course substitution If the transfer course in question does not transfer directly as an approved substitution then you will need to submit an Elements Course Substitution Form after you ve transferred the course in to UT This means you must have completed the course with a C or better and send in your transcript to be evaluated by UT s Office of Admissions Once that evaluation is on your records please submit the Elements Course Substitution Form Please print read through follow all the instructions and fill out the form These petitions are not guaranteed for approval and you will be sent a SAN once the Elements faculty advisor makes a final decision The final decision may not be appealed What courses count as substitutions Courses that could be considered as substitutions are anything taken outside the Department of Computer Science here at the University of Texas at Austin This includes study abroad courses even if they are approved as Elements equivalents i e CS 329E What are the requirements for the 18 hour transcripted certificate The new requirements are for students who are in the 2016 2018 catalog and beyond for their major If you are not sure what catalog year you are under please contact your academic advisor The new requirements for the 18 hour certificate include the following CS 303E or an approved equivalent is required CS 313E or an approved equivalent is required At least twelve hours of upper division Elements elective courses or approved equivalents are required Only two course substitutions are permitted All courses must be taken for a letter grade with a grade of C or better Note You may claim AP credit for CS 312 When do I submit the survey for the Elements certification Students may apply for certification on the semester they are completing their last requirements They do not need to be graduating on that semester because the graduation application is a completely different process In order for us to certify you for a given semester please submit the certification application by the deadline below If any of these dates fall on a weekend please submit the

is no policy against current employees applying for the scholarship However there are some things to consider before applying for the scholarship when you are currently employed fulltime 1 Participants awarded the scholarship must be enrolled fulltime and very few if any universities allow SFS students to take online courses The majority of the programs require you to be on campus 2 Most SFS participating institutions don t allow SFS students to work while in school and if they do it s limited to less than 10 hours per week Anything more than 20 hours per week will make you ineligible for the stipend 3 If applicable i e if you are a current government employee there s no guarantee you would go back to the same agency you are currently at 4 There s no guarantee you would be able to stay in the same location Each university manages their program individually so policy concerning the above could vary by university The best suggestion would be to contact the university you are interested in and explain your specific situation to see if you would be eligible to apply and if so how your current employment would be affected 2 1111While many of the participating universities may offer an online cybersecurity degree program they do not offer the scholarship for online programs There may be a few that will allow some courses to be online but you have to be on

anything less than a GS 9 You could certainly search for higher graded jobs and would most likely have success However we would not allow you to turn down offers that were at the GS 9 or above If all that s offered to you is a GS 9 then you would be required to accept it You could then continue to search for a position that better meets the salary you are searching for but in the beginning if all you are offered is a GS 9 and you turn that down looking for that higher salary you could be required to repay the scholarship in full Employment must be with a Government agency Work as an Independent Contractor will not meet that requirement 4 1113Yes you are eligible to apply However while there may be some agencies in the Federal government that can hire permanent residents for their

Upper division standing FAQ FAQ The following questions are frequently asked in orientation meetings If you have a question that is not answered attend a meeting of MISA or contact the Undergraduate Programs Office What is the difference in job opportunities for Computer Sciences and MIS Majors Both majors have excellent career opportunities Most students who work with their respective placement centers have job offers before they graduate MIS majors have among the highest average salary offers for business majors MIS majors are most likely to go into positions in information services for companies or consulting while CS majors are most likely to go into manufacturing support systems and product development for computer companies Over 60 of the MIS majors each year accept offers with consulting firms a much rarer starting position for Computer Science majors Retailers insurance and communications firms also hire MIS majors through the Career Services Office What are the differences in the entry level jobs for Computer Science and MIS majors Some graduates go into the same type of programmer analyst positions but most CS majors accept jobs that are more technical and less involved with people than the positions accepted by MIS majors Sometimes titles differ for example programmer rather than consultant or end user support staff sometimes the title is the same but the responsibilities differ What is the difference in the course work for CS and MIS majors The degree plans show that the freshmen and sophomore courses are similar and the junior and senior courses are completely different MIS majors must take 33 hours of business courses in addition to the minimum of 21 hours of MIS courses Unlike CS almost all MIS classes require significant group projects Project management and people issues are emphasized in the MIS courses more often than in CS which has more technical depth especially on topics such as operating systems and programming languages Do I need to be good in math No but you need to handle complex issues and ambiguity well Information systems are frequently complex solutions to messy organizational problems so your effectiveness with other people is critical I m a senior who decided only recently that I want to be an MIS major How do I take the MIS classes in the minimum number of semesters The MIS Major requires at least three semesters Semester one take MIS 304 and MIS 325 Semester two take MIS 333K and one MIS upper division elective Semester three take MIS 374 and your second elective course Most MIS elective courses are topics under MIS 373 What are the best electives for MIS majors Some recruiters want to see many CS and MIS hours on your resume but others want to see extracurricular activities that show leadership and personal skills I am in another college at UT How can I transfer into the business school The BBA Programs Office at the McCombs School of Business provides information on their website There is no separate transfer for MIS majors All applicants are reviewed and notified by the BBA Programs Office After you have been admitted to the business school you may declare your major as MIS I just want to be a general manager why can t I leave all this information technology stuff to the technicians IT is becoming a key strategic resource for more and more organizations and some technical staff do not understand the business side of things well If you owned a company would you feel comfortable leaving key strategic decisions to these technical types Those managers who understand IT and how it may be effectively used for competitive advantage will themselves have a competitive advantage in the employment market Will the MIS major turn me into an IT geek No It will however introduce you to enough IT concepts and jargon so that you will be able to understand what geeks are talking about If you are a geek when you enroll the major will teach you how to be understood by IT ignorant managers Will the MIS major turn me into a programmer No Although you WILL be required to take several technical classes we are not in the business of training programmers In the major you will learn enough about what programmers and other IT types do to be able to better work with them I don t need to know anything about auto mechanics to drive a car Why do I have to learn about the details of Information Technology Your comment about driving a car is true now but remember that cars today are the product of a century of development If it were 1919 it would certainly be wise for you to know a bit of auto mechanics before you took a long trip In its development cycle when compared to automobiles 1919 is arguably about where IT is so we feel some hands on experience is advisable We are back in this assessment by managers from companies such as Fed Ex P G GM Intel Dell and IBM as well as from the leading consulting companies Since IT is changing so rapidly won t all the things we learn in this major be obsolete by the time we graduate First we teach you the basic concepts and the economics of IT which change much more slowly so these will still be viable when you graduate Second as part of the major you will learn how to learn about developments in IT so you will have the skills to keep up with IT developments I have been working as a programmer systems analyst network manager etc for the past four years aren t courses in Information Technology just a waste of time No Your knowledge of IT is most likely from a largely technical perspective Our courses are focused on how businesses can use IT to improve their competitive positions However you may wish to take only a minimum of MIS courses and take more courses in Finance Marketing Operations Organization Behavior

Continuity and working from home You are hereHome What type of computer should I buy We get this question often from prospective students so we asked our ambassadors experienced CS students to answer As far as computers go every CS student has access to the computers in the 3rd floor and basement labs of the Bill and Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex for their programming and general purpose needs as well as the computers around campus in the libraries and other computer labs for general purpose use The computer labs in Gates are open 24 7 for student use Therefore the type of computer that you should buy in preparation for coming to college should be one that you are comfortable using There is no departmental preference between Windows Mac Unix or Chrome operating systems In terms of hardware few classes will actually stress your computer to the point where processors overheating becomes an issue and for CS classes that require a lot of computing power for simulations or graphics most students use the computers in the labs Most computer science classes do not allow students to take notes on laptops during class so laptop use in class would likely only be for non CS courses and would probably consist of note taking For example a student recalls using a laptop with a processor that was 2 or 3 steps behind the i3 as well as one with an i3 processor and had no laptop related problems While having a laptop in college is not a requirement I definitely recommend that students bring one just in case they need to use a computer while in their dorm room As for the type of computer the best short answer that I can give is for you to bring the laptop that you are most comfortable using because you won t have to do anything on your personal computer remotely that you wouldn t be able to do on a lab computer besides take notes in class It is definitely common for students to have basic laptops for general purpose use For example a student might primarily use their laptop for note taking and occasionally remote accessing to one of the CS machines at UT to do programming If a student requires the use of a certain software or needs to be on the network and etc they typically choose to work in the labs There are students who have more advanced laptops and even desktops but it s definitely not required and most people use these more advanced systems for personal use such as gaming not because it s a requirement of the major This is why we suggest prospective students to buy whatever laptop they feel comfortable working on and has the capability to do what they would want to do outside of class FAQ category Prospective Students 2317 Speedway Stop D9500 Austin TX 78712 Phone 512 471 7316 The University of Texas at Austin 2020 Undergraduate
