enrollment Students from 25 states and 14 countries Diversity Equity Inclusion College of Natural Sciences The College of Natural Sciences aims to ensure that everyone feels welcomed By fostering an inclusive environment where people of all backgrounds are valued the intellectual rigor and quality of research produced by the college is enriched The Diversity Equity Inclusion page offers information and resources to empower students faculty and to offer their unique perspective on the Forty Acres Computer Science Texas Computer Science is committed to supporting and advocating for the full engagement and empowerment of underrepresented groups in the field of computing The department seeks to advance the cause by recruiting retaining and educating a more diverse student population and supporting and celebrating a diverse and inclusive culture and community FLIP Alliance Texas Computer Science is a founding member of the Diversifying Future Leadership in the Professoriate FLIP Alliance The goal of the NSF funded FLIP Alliance is to address the broadening participation challenge of increasing the diversity of the future leadership in the professoriate in computing at research universities as a way to achieve diversity across the field In particular the problem that we address is stark and straightforward only 4 3 of the current tenure track faculty in computing at these universities are from underrepresented groups The FLIP Alliance solution is equally stark and straightforward we intentionally bring together the very small number of departments responsible for producing the majority of the professoriate with individuals and organizations that understand how to recruit retain and develop students from underrepresented groups in order to create a network that can quickly and radically change the demographic diversity of the professoriate across the entire field We invite interested corporate partners to help us advance this mission through Computing for Diversity and Student Conferences We invite current and prospective students to join and stand with the department s student led organizations focused on diversity inclusion and representation in computer science Association of Black Computer Scientists ABCS Code Orange Hispanic Association of Computer Scientists HACS Q Women in Computer Science WiCS Students At UT Computer Science

Database useful It is a searchable database in which one may look up the UT equivalent for any college course offered within the state of Texas Keep in mind that the University imposes a residency requirement In order to receive an undergraduate degree you must complete 60 hours in residence at UT Austin CS readiness CNS information for incoming students Question What type of computer should I buy We get this question often from prospective students so we asked our ambassadors experienced CS students to answer As far as computers go every CS student has access to the computers in the 3rd floor and basement labs of the Bill and Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex for their programming and general purpose needs as well as the computers around campus in the libraries and other computer labs for general purpose use The computer labs in Gates are open 24 7 for student use Therefore the type of computer that you should buy in preparation for coming to college should be one that you are comfortable using There is no departmental preference between Windows Mac Unix or Chrome operating systems In terms of hardware few classes will actually stress your computer to the point where processors overheating becomes an issue and for CS classes that require a lot of computing power for simulations or graphics most students use the computers in the labs Most computer science classes do not allow students to take notes on laptops during class so laptop use in class would likely only be for non CS courses and would probably consist of note taking For example a student recalls using a laptop with a processor that was 2 or 3 steps behind the i3 as well as one with an i3 processor and had no laptop related problems While having a laptop in college is not a requirement I definitely recommend that students bring one just in case they need to use a computer while in their dorm room As for the type of computer the best short answer that I can give is for you to bring the laptop that you are most comfortable using because you won t have to do anything on your personal computer remotely that you wouldn t be able to do on a lab computer besides take notes in class It is definitely common for students to have basic laptops for general purpose use For example a student might primarily use their laptop for note taking and occasionally remote accessing to one of the CS machines at UT to do programming If a student requires the use of a certain software or needs to be on the network and etc they typically choose to work in the labs There are students who have more advanced laptops and even desktops but it s definitely not required and most people use these more advanced systems for personal use such as gaming not because it s a requirement of the major This is why we suggest prospective students to buy whatever laptop they feel comfortable working on and has the capability to do what they would want to do outside of class Undergraduate AdmissionsProspective

on COVID 19 Get help with Instructional Continuity and working from home You are hereHome Undergraduate Academics Advising Preparing for Graduate School Advancing your studies past the Bachelors degree can be a wonderful experience Learning about the cutting edge of the field and possibly doing research that moves the field forward can be very rewarding Students often have questions about graduate school and hopefully this page and the associated links will help you figure out if graduate school is for you What Graduate Degrees are Available That depends on your field In computer science the primary graduate degrees are the Masters MA or MS and the Doctorate PhD in computer science The Masters degree is comprised primarily of coursework that builds on your undergraduate work and better prepares you for industry or further graduate studies It may involve writing a thesis The Doctorate moves past the Masters course work to individual research in a specific area of computer science A PhD is required for a career in academia It also can prepare you for a career in industrial research Some PhD programs require a Masters degree before you can be admitted others accept students who have completed just a Bachelors degree How do I Prepare If you think you might want to go to graduate school it is important that you start preparing early Here is a list of things that are important for grad school admissions The rigor of your undergraduate CS and mathematics courses Your undergraduate GPA Letters of recommendation particularly from faculty members who know your work well Your GRE scores Your other CS experiences including internships and research While your GPA is important to a graduate admissions committee the committee will also look at several other factors You will need to find between three and five faculty to write letters of recommendation for you It is best if these faculty know you well The best way to get to know a faculty member is to do an individual research project CS 370 and possibly CS 379H You should plan on starting this during your junior year so that your results can be reflected in your letters You also need to take the general GRE exam For some schools you will need to take the CS subject exam You should take the CS subject exam as late as possible so that you can use what you have learned in all of your courses To prepare for the CS exam take a look at a sample test Depending on the classes you have taken you may need to fill in some gaps in what you have learned Graduate School Preparation Graduate admission committees are looking for students who are likely to succeed in research The best way to convince them that you are one of those students is to get involved in research as an undergraduate See more on how to get involved in research Documenting research requires technical writing skills Students considering graduate school may want to prepare by enrolling for CS 234 Technical Writing This is a small class with lots of opportunity for individual attention that will help satisfy your substantial writing component requirement What School Should I Go To The answer to this question is very difficult Your primary consideration should be a school at which you can succeed and accomplish your goals Perhaps you want to go to a school that specializes in computer theory or maybe a school that is strong with no particular specialization Once you have some idea of the area s that you may want to study find a CS faculty member whose work is in that those area s Go to office hours or ask for an appointment to talk about schools that are strong in your area s Paying for Graduate School Most PhD students are supported by their department or by an external fellowship Many Masters students are also supported by their departments As you are considering schools you should look at their websites to find out what levels of support they offer to their students There are also fellowships that are awarded by external organizations If you receive one of these you can take it to any school to which you are admitted NSF Graduate Fellowships Fannie John Hertz Foundation Fellowships

be promoted into the upper division sequence Promotion Requirements CS entry level students must complete all requirements in order to be promoted into the upper division sequence 1 2 75 entry level GPA in all CS entry level classes which are CS 312 CS 311 and CS 314 2 Complete all CS entry level sequence courses with no grade lower than a C 3 Complete all CS entry level courses in no more than 2 attempts students may appeal to receive a third and final attempt at an entry level course if they have a verified non academic Q drop within the semester the course was taken 4 Maintain UT GPA of 2 0 Transfer courses taken prior to iniital enrollment at the University of Texas at Austin may be reviewed and if approved can substitute for the entry level courses Upon enrollment at the University of Texas at Austin all remaining entry level courses must be taken in residence Although the CS entry level GPA is calculated into the overall UT GPA the CS entry level GPA is different from the overall UT GPA The CS entry level GPA only includes CS 312 CS 311 and CS 314 The overall UT GPA includes all courses taken in residence Here is the GPA Calculator to help calculate the CS entry level GPA Students records will be reviewed following the posting of grades at the conclusion of each long semester and summer Students who meet the requirements for promotion will be automatically promoted into the major Please note University policy states that you may NOT for any reason retake a course if you have made a C or better That is true of our entry level courses as well College of Natural Sciences Computer Science Repetition of a Course Policy As stated in the Undergraduate Catalog no more than two attempts are allowed for a given course offered by the College of Natural Sciences A third and final attempt may be granted if a student receives a non academic Q drop Q or Withdrawal W from the College of Natural Sciences Dean s Office This includes all computer science science and math statistics courses These rules apply to students who are completing entry level requirements as well as those who have been promoted into their respective Computer Science degree If a student cannot complete a course that is required for a degree in Computer Science because they are not allowed any further attempts they will be required to change majors Students must make at least a C in all computer science math and science courses that are required for their degree It is strongly suggested that students contact the CNS Non Academic Counselors immediately if they feel a non academic situation has occurred in a given semester that has the possibility of disrupting their ability to complete the course successfully Below are the guidelines set forth by the College of Natural Sciences to potentially qualify for a non academic Q drop or Withdrawal Their phone number is 512 471 4536 and their office is located in WCH 1 106 if students feel they need to schedule an appointment Non academic Q drop s or Withdrawal up until the Mid semester Deadline can be considered for non academic reasons through the CNS Dean s Office These non academic reasons include documentable medical mental health or other life problems that students encounter such as deaths financial duress legal conflicts etc The student would have to meet with a CNS Non academic Counselor to discuss the situation to see if it qualifies for the Non academic Q Drop or Withdrawal Official documentation is required for any Non academic Q drop s or Withdrawal After the Drop Deadline Non academic Q drop s or Withdrawal is only considered for non academic reasons through the CNS Dean s Office if the following criteria is met 1 the student had been passing with a C or better up until the drop deadline so there was no reason to drop then 2 something urgent and critical occurred after this date that can be documented that is now impacting the student s course work An appeal can be done through the Non academic Counselors for consideration of Non academic Q drop s or Withdrawal based on this criteria Undergraduate Admissions AcademicsAdvising Concentrations Curriculum Degree

I meet with a CS advisor to discuss the certificate At the moment CS advisors do not meet with non CS students If a student still has questions after reading this website they can email elements cs utexas edu for further information and clarification Do I need to apply for the certificate to start taking courses Students must apply and have the certificate attached to their degree profile and set to pursuing in order to gain access to the upper division Elements electives Students who do not have the certificate attached and set to pursuing will not be able to register for or waitlist the upper division courses Students can apply for the certificate here This does not apply to students who are on the 2014 2016 or prior catalogs When should I attach the certificate As soon as possible Once you have applied for the certificate and been approved via SAN please contact your advisor and ask them to officially attach the certificate to your degree profile It must be attached and set to pursuing in order to gain access to the upper division Elements courses I applied for the certificate and my advisor says it s attached but it s not set to pursuing What do I do Email elements cs utexas edu with your name and EID and ask that your certificate be set to pursuing The certificate is attached and set to pursuing do I have priority for the Elements courses No you have access to register for or waitlist the upper division courses What if I am on the 2014 2016 or prior catalog Students following the 2014 2016 or prior catalogs do not have the function of having the certificate attached to their degree profile so please email elements cs utexas edu prior to registration in order to gain further instructions on how to access the Elements courses Can the certificate be made to Stand Alone No we will not make certificate Stand Alone they need to be attached to a degree profile and set to pursuing Am I required to take CS 303E or an approved equivalent Yes All students seeking the Elements certificate are required to take CS 303E or an approved equivalent Students who have AP credit for CS 312 may claim that course and it be counted towards the certificate Am I required to take CS 313E or an approved equivalent Students who are on the 2016 2018 catalog and beyond for their major and seeking the 18 hour certificate are required to take CS 313E or an approved equivalent If I have an approved equivalent for CS 303E and or CS 313E how will I be able to register for upper division Elements courses It is very likely that you will need a pre req waiver in this case Please email elements cs utexas edu provide your name EID which course is substituting for the pre req and which course you will like to be waived for We will respond to you ASAP once we ve created a pre req waiver and it is up to you to register for the course on your own A pre req waiver does not guarantee a spot in the course You will only be granted a pre req waiver for an APPROVED course substitution Here s an example of a pre req waiver request Name John Smith eID JH123 Substitution EE 312 for CS 303E Course s to be waived CS 324E and CS 327E Which upper division courses do not have CS 313E as a pre req As of the moment the CS 324E and 327E topics courses only require CS 303E as a pre req Many Elements courses require CS 313E as a pre req which is why it is highly recommended that students take the course prior to taking upper division Elements courses We will not waive pre reqs if students do not have an approved pre req course If I took CS 303E already does that mean I can no longer take CS 302 Correct CS 302 will not be an option once you have credit for CS 303E or an approved equivalent Additionally CS 302 will not count towards the Elements certificate if the course is taken after you ve received credit for CS 303E or an approved equivalent Students following the 2016 2018 and newer catalogs cannot use CS 302 towards the certificate When should I start taking courses for the Elements certificate In order to have the best chance at completing the Elements of Computing certificate by graduation students should take at least one Elements course each semester beginning in the sophomore year Elements courses have limited seating and students will not be given special priority when registering Students must have at least 50 of the certificate completed if they wish to complete any remaining coursework after graduation additionally students must complete all requirements and apply for certification within one academic year after graduation Are upper division Elements guaranteed by Senior Countdown Attaching the certificate to your degree profile DOES NOT change its status and is not considered a degree requirement and therefore is not guaranteed under Senior Countdown or any other similar program May I take any Elements courses pass fail No All Elements courses and any approved equivalents counting towards the Elements certificate will need to be taken for a letter grade You will need to receive a C or better in order for the course s to count towards the Elements certificate How many Elements courses are offered each semester Are you expecting to add more courses to the course schedule The number of Elements courses offered each semester varies It is highly possible that we are not expecting to add more courses to the course schedule however please check the course schedule periodically because any changes will reflect on the course schedule What is the max number of Elements upper division courses I can take in a semester Students have the opportunity to take a max of three Elements upper division courses in a semester this is highly unlikely though due to the demand of the courses Can I register for three Elements upper division courses during the initial registration period No I can only register for two Elements courses during the first registration period so when can I add a third course to my schedule Students have the potential to add or waitlist a third Elements course during the add drop period What does it mean if a course is Approved through a specified semester That means if you took the course on or prior to the listed semester it is an approved substitution for the Elements certificate regardless of when you apply for certification Taking the course past the semester will need approval from the Elements faculty advisor in order for it to be a valid substitution What if I would like to petition a non approved course substitution for the Elements certificate You must be registered for the course and have received or will be expecting to receive a C or better letter grade Please print read through follow all the instructions and fill out the Elements Course Substitution Form These petitions are not guaranteed for approval and you will be sent a SAN once the Elements faculty advisor makes a final decision The final decision may not be appealed How do I go about getting a transfer course evaluated as a course substitution If the transfer course in question does not transfer directly as an approved substitution then you will need to submit an Elements Course Substitution Form after you ve transferred the course in to UT This means you must have completed the course with a C or better and send in your transcript to be evaluated by UT s Office of Admissions Once that evaluation is on your records please submit the Elements Course Substitution Form Please print read through follow all the instructions and fill out the form These petitions are not guaranteed for approval and you will be sent a SAN once the Elements faculty advisor makes a final decision The final decision may not be appealed What courses count as substitutions Courses that could be considered as substitutions are anything taken outside the Department of Computer Science here at the University of Texas at Austin This includes study abroad courses even if they are approved as Elements equivalents i e CS 329E What are the requirements for the 18 hour transcripted certificate The new requirements are for students who are in the 2016 2018 catalog and beyond for their major If you are not sure what catalog year you are under please contact your academic advisor The new requirements for the 18 hour certificate include the following CS 303E or an approved equivalent is required CS 313E or an approved equivalent is required At least twelve hours of upper division Elements elective courses or approved equivalents are required Only two course substitutions are permitted All courses must be taken for a letter grade with a grade of C or better Note You may claim AP credit for CS 312 When do I submit the survey for the Elements certification Students may apply for certification on the semester they are completing their last requirements They do not need to be graduating on that semester because the graduation application is a completely different process In order for us to certify you for a given semester please submit the certification application by the deadline below If any of these dates fall on a weekend please submit the

Transfer Courses Concurrent Enrollment Can I transfer courses I have taken from another university Many students transfer academic credit from other colleges Speak to your advisor if you plan to take courses at another institution Information about how coursework transfers to UT from schools in Texas can be found on the Automated Transfer Equivalency website Students transferring courses from out of state schools should talk to an admissions counselor in the Office of Admissions MAI 7 Any courses completed at another educational institution MUST be transferred to UT Students must receive a C or better in any transfer courses to count towards their degree Transferred coursework does not count towards your UT GPA but rather counts as credit on your transcript All you need to do to have the credit on your record is to request an official transcript from the college or university be sent to UT Austin and admissions will post those credits automatically to your record Please be aware that this process can take time in order to go through all the processing steps Students may not take C S entry level courses out of residence once they have started their first semester at UT Austin At this point all entry level courses must be taken at UT Austin Permalink Can I take math or science classes outside of UT You may ONLY take math and science classes outside of UT during the SUMMER semester You cannot take them during Fall Spring Winter Minimesters etc You should check the Automated Transfer Equivalency and check with your advisor if you are planning to transfer courses in required for your degree If a student chooses to have concurrent enrollment in math and science courses in at any time other than the summer semester those courses will not apply to the student s degree in the College of Natural Sciences and the Department of Computer Science Concurrent enrollment is not permitted during the semester in which a student expects to graduate You do not need to officially inform UT that you are taking the courses though you may want to check with your advisor that they will count correctly You only need to send the official transcript from the college or university to UT Permalink Can I take classes at a community college or through University Extension while also taking classes at UT If you are a student in the College of Natural Sciences you CANNOT take any math or science courses required for your degree at a community college during the fall and spring semesters You may take courses such as English Social Science History or Government but you must still be enrolled in at least 9 hours at UT You may take courses via UT correspondence or UT Extension during the fall and spring semesters while also enrolled at UT During the summer students may take any classes at other institutions without any UT hour requirements You should check the Automated Transfer Equivalency and check with your advisor if you are planning to transfer courses in required for your degree Permalink Prospective Students What type of computer should I buy We get this question often from prospective students so we asked our ambassadors experienced CS students to answer As far as computers go every CS student has access to the computers in the 3rd floor and basement labs of the Bill and Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex for their programming and general purpose needs as well as the computers around campus in the libraries and other computer labs for general purpose use The computer labs in Gates are open 24 7 for student use Therefore the type of computer that you should buy in preparation for coming to college should be one that you are comfortable using There is no departmental preference between Windows Mac Unix or Chrome operating systems In terms of hardware few classes will actually stress your computer to the point where processors overheating becomes an issue and for CS classes that require a lot of computing power for simulations or graphics most students use the computers in the labs Most computer science classes do not allow students to take notes on laptops during class so laptop use in class would likely only be for non CS courses and would probably consist of note taking For example a student recalls using a laptop with a processor that was 2 or 3 steps behind the i3 as well as one with an i3 processor and had no laptop related problems While having a laptop in college is not a requirement I definitely recommend that students bring one just in case they need to use a computer while in their dorm room As for the type of computer the best short answer that I can give is for you to bring the laptop that you are most comfortable using because you won t have to do anything on your personal computer remotely that you wouldn t be able to do on a lab computer besides take notes in class It is definitely common for students to have basic laptops for general purpose use For example a student might primarily use their laptop for note taking and occasionally remote accessing to one of the CS machines at UT to do programming If a student requires the use of a certain software or needs to be on the network and etc they typically choose to work in the labs There are students who have more advanced laptops and even desktops but it s definitely not required and most people use these more advanced systems for personal use such as gaming not because it s a requirement of the major This is why we suggest prospective students to buy whatever laptop they feel comfortable working on and has the capability to do what they would want to do outside of class Permalink 2317 Speedway Stop D9500 Austin TX 78712 Phone 512 471 7316 The University of Texas at Austin 2020 Undergraduate Office Graduate Office

research program has the breadth you would expect from such a department We have built an autonomous car developed algorithms to map the tree of life designed compilers for multicore architectures and examined ways to assure security and privacy on the Internet We are ranked in the top 10 in the country in four research areas Programming Languages Artificial Intelligence Systems and Theory See the Department s research page for a more comprehensive description of our research program and to start finding faculty who work in the areas that interest you What research involves The Department of Computer Science actively encourages undergraduates to get involved in research Your long term career goal may be to become a software engineer an entrepreneur a professor an industrial researcher or a patent attorney Regardless an undergraduate research experience can be an eye opening and rewarding experience Research involves Being innovative Accepting responsibility Taking risks Basking in the glow of a new result How to get involved in research UT encourages all its students to get involved in research The College of Natural Sciences has created a web page to help science students find research opportunities There are two ways to begin your research at UT Take a Freshman Research Initiative FRI course EUREKA is a UT wide effort to encourage undergraduate research Check their site for additional opportunities Find a faculty member and begin working on a project Students generally do this during their junior and or senior year but there are opportunities for talented sophomores as well Many faculty members require that students have taken one of their courses before joining their research teams So you should start early to think about the area s you might want to do research in Then take the relevant classes How to fit research in Most students choose to get course credit for some of their research time Research is for everyone It prepares you for a creative career But since many students may be thinking about research specifically because they know they want to go on to graduate school we include here a link to our page on preparing for graduate school All students are invited to become involved in our research activity Students who are pursuing an honors degree the Natural Sciences College s Dean s Scholars degree the CS Department s Turing Scholars degree or Special Departmental Honors must complete an Honors Thesis that describes the results of a supervised research project Visit the Honors Thesis Archive to get an idea of the breadth of the work our students do The UT Undergraduate Research Journal is a student edited and published multidisciplinary journal Its purpose is to highlight the research and independent studies of undergraduate students

prepare a written dissertation proposal document and select a committee for approval by the graduate adviser The committee must be composed of a minimum of 4 members of which 1 must be someone whose teaching and research are principally outside of the department and three members including the supervisor must be members of the CS department s Graduate Studies Committee GSC A committee can be composed of six members provided at least 4 are members of GSC s 3 from the CS GSC while 1 can be from another department s GSC The Graduate Adviser must approve your committee prior to making final committee plans an email message will do Be sure what you send to the graduate adviser for approval includes a short description of your dissertation and what role you foresee for each proposed committee member in helping you reach your research goals The approved committee will examine the student on the proposal If they are unanimously satisfied that the proposed work if substantially completed would constitute an acceptable dissertation and that the student has the potential for substantially completing the work then they will recommend admission to candidacy 1 below and sign the required form found under the forms section of the graduate tab Admission to candidacy must be approved by the Department s Graduate Studies Committee and the Graduate School Select a date and time when all committee members can be present for the proposal At least your research supervisor must be present at the proposal It is allowable for the 3 others to attend the proposal virtually A final draft of your proposal should be submitted to committee members four weeks prior to the date of the proposal Schedule a room for your proposal through the online calendar When the administrator has approved your request you will receive email confirming the approval The Graduate Coordinator will publicize your proposal Approximately 3 weeks prior to the date you must give the graduate coordinator all the necessary information i e date time place title of dissertation and an abstract of your proposal Email is the easiest way to do that The graduate coordinator will then send out the public announcement two weeks prior to the date of the proposal This is not a firm deadline but the graduate coordinator does need to receive all the information at least several days in advance of the two week deadline to send out the information Pass the proposal exam At least 3 members of the committee must be present at the exam which may include questions over the entire depth area it is not necessarily limited to the specific dissertation research topic Questions from any GSC member are encouraged The following criteria will be used to determine whether or not a student passes the exam Does the candidate demonstrate knowledge of his her depth area If substantially completed would the work described in the proposal constitute an acceptable dissertation Does the student display the potential for substantially completing the work Passing of the exam requires the unanimous approval of the committee on these three points Be sure to obtain committee signatures on the Dissertation Proposal Committee Approval Form found under the forms sections of the graduate tab If unanimous approval does not occur a student may reform a committee or alter the topic S he is then required to retake the examination until unanimous approval is obtained After passing your proposal exam and submitting the required Dissertation Proposal Committee Approval Form to the CS graduate office you will need to complete an online Application for Candidacy This form is now available through the Graduate School s website You may begin the online application process before the proposal but do not submit it until you pass the proposal Once you submit an email will go to your research supervisor letting them know and they should approve it if you passed If final approval is not received within a week of that please contact the graduate office for follow up If you have any questions regarding completing the form the Graduate Coordinator can help you NOTE It is not necessary to fill out the Program of Work form This has been noted by the submission of your Depth Proposal or Research Qualification RQ Document A curriculum vita for any member of your committee who is not a GSC member should be submitted to the Graduate Coordinator as soon as possible either before or after completing the on line candidacy form You will receive official notification when the Dean

Continuity and working from home You are hereHome Graduate Courses Former Ph D program This page describes the requirements of the old Ph D program Students have the option of graduating under this program if their first enrollment as graduate students at UT was in 2005 or earlier For steps towards graduation go to the section Application to Candidacy Graduation The Ph D is a research degree Our Ph D students also take courses which give them the foundation on which to build their research programs But the overriding goal of the Ph D program is to show students how to do outstanding research We expect all our Ph D students to become involved in research within their first semester here see Research Immersion below and continue their involvement throughout their time at UT To get a good feeling for the way in which our Ph D students are involved in our research activities browse our research web pages As a consequence of early immersion in research our Ph D students are often already recognized in the wider research community well before they graduate They regularly travel to conferences present papers and sometimes receive best paper awards Most Ph D students receive financial support from the department Each year approximately 12 incoming students are awarded doctoral fellowships which guarantee support for four years Additional students will be offered Teaching Assistantships The department s faculty also brings in substantial research funding much of which is used to support graduate students on Research Assistantships Degree Requirements Students must have an undergraduate degree in computer science or an allied field such as engineering or math with appropriate CS background to be admitted into the Ph D program Each student who is admitted must then satisfy the following requirements Background Most students have the equivalent of CS 345 Programming Languages CS 352 Architecture CS 372 Operating Systems and CS 375 Compilers at the time they are admitted If students have specific deficiencies such as missing prerequisites for graduate courses they wish to take these deficiencies can be made up by taking appropriate undergraduate courses Research Immersion Doctoral students are required to enroll in a special research course CS 398T during their first semester in the program Students entering in Spring will be required to take this course the following Fall As part of this class students will be expected to find a research supervisor with whom the student will work throughout the first year All doctoral students are required to enroll in and complete a research course CS 395 each semester until they advance to candidacy Doctoral students may not enroll for 12 or more hours unless they receive special permission from the Graduate Advisor Such permission is granted rarely and only based on written justification from the student s research supervisor Breadth Students satisfy this requirement by taking an approved set of 5 courses 2 from each of two breadth areas and one from a third breadth area Theory Systems Applications At most one numerical analysis course may be counted toward this requirement At most one of CS 386 and CS 387H may be counted See Breadth Courses for a list of the breadth courses that are offered All courses used to satisfy this requirement must be completed with a grade of B or better and a combined grade point average of 3 5 must be achieved on the 5 courses used to satisfy the breadth requirement An overall grade point average of 3 1 must be maintained on all breadth courses taken Breadth Course Waivers may be used to fulfill some breadth requirements A Breadth Course Waiver is granted when a student has taken a graduate level course at another university and that course is equivalent to a UT CS breadth course and the student is able to demonstrate a satisfactory understanding of this material to a Graduate Studies Committee GSC member who teaches the breadth course The GSC member may choose any method to evaluate the student s knowledge a written or an oral examination is possible At most one Breadth Course Waiver may be used in each breadth area Depth Students satisfy this requirement by taking a set of at least 3 courses related to their particular research interests At most one of these courses may be outside the Computer Sciences Department they are usually chosen from the CS department s list of graduate classes Courses listed as breadth courses may be used as part of a depth program as long as they were not also used in the student s breadth program No CS 395 conference or CS 398T course may be included in a depth proposal All courses used to satisfy this requirement must be completed with a grade of B or better A grade point average of 3 6 over all depth courses must be attained Oral Speaking Requirement Students satisfy this requirement by giving at least three public presentations of approximately one hour s duration Students have a variety of opportunities such as seminar courses for satisfying this requirement presentations at conferences can also be counted In the case of a presentation at a conference it is not necessary for a GSC member to be present in order to sign the form The dissertation proposal and defense may not be included This requirement makes it imperative that students be able to communicate effectively and publicly in English At least one of the oral presentations must be given prior to scheduling the dissertation proposal Dissertation Proposal Each student must prepare a written dissertation proposal and then give an oral public presentation of the proposal This will normally happen soon after the RQ document is filed The student must at this point assemble a tentative dissertation committee that has been approved by the graduate advisor Be sure what you send to the graduate adviser for approval includes a short description of your dissertation and what role you foresee for each proposed committee member in helping you reach your research goals The approved committee will examine the student on the proposal If they are unanimously satisfied that the proposed work if substantially completed would constitute an acceptable dissertation and that the student has the potential for substantially completing the work then they will recommend admission to candidacy Admission to candidacy must be approved by the Department s Graduate Studies Committee and the Graduate School IMPORTANT The graduate school requires enrollment in 2 semesters of dissertation 99R and 99W Summer may count as 1 of the semesters of enrollment You must be in candidacy by the 1st 12 class days of a semester you wish to enroll in dissertation hours so you can register for or add drop to dissertation hours You must be enrolled in dissertation hours continuously in fall and spring semesters until graduation Enrollment in 99R is required only once After the initial 99R enrollment enroll in 99W You must be enrolled in 99W in the semester you plan to graduate If that s summer then summer enrollment is required Dissertation Final Defense Each student must write a dissertation that describes original research and submit it to the members of his her committee There are many resources to help in writing a dissertation The student will then give a public presentation and defense of the dissertation research When the committee is satisfied with the dissertation they will so inform the Graduate School Additional Requirements A minimum grade point average of 3 0 must be maintained over all CS graduate courses All course requirements must be completed with a six year period A minimum one year residency after application to candidacy is required The Requirements of the Graduate School The Graduate School imposes a set of requirements on all graduate students which must be met by all CS graduate students These requirements deal with such issues as grades courses taken in residence transfer credit and time limits This page describes the Breadth course system that was used prior to Fall 2005 Students who first enrolled prior to 2006 may choose to graduate under this program Graduate courses are divided into two groups Breadth courses can be used to satisfy the breadth requirements of either the Ph D or the Masters degree They may also be used as part of a student

fellowships Exceptional incoming computer scientists in our graduate program are candidates for the prestigious new Provost s Graduate Excellence Fellowship or the Calhoun Graduate Excellence Fellowship The University of Texas at Austin is working to identify talented and exemplary graduate students to receive four years of fellowship support The goal is to help selected students excel in their vital role of advancing research mentoring undergraduates and fostering discovery alongside our top tier faculty The Department of Computer Science is pleased to be able to offer a limited number of candidates of the highest promise these competitive multi year fellowships Students with outstanding academic records and those who have established a track record of success as researchers and innovators will be automatically considered for these elite awards Provost s or Calhoun Graduate Excellence Fellowship support includes a 9 month stipend of 24 300 In addition fellows receive up to 4 000 over four years in research and travel support a waiver of tuition and fees and University medical benefits The total compensation package is valued at over 153 000 per recipient For two of the four years fellows receive these stipends as standalone support The remaining two years tie stipends to work as a teaching assistant or a graduate research assistant in a faculty member s lab Students are asked to teach for either one or two years only as this amount of time instructing others is considered optimal for our graduate students professional development Research Assistantships Some students enter our program with research assistantships however research assistantships normally are appointed on a semester basis These are under the purview of the individual professors and are generally made after the student has been enrolled for at least 1 2 semesters A GRA appointment is typically for 20 hours per week for the semester and covers the student s tuition fees and insurance Most students find a research supervisor during the second or third year and may be supported as research assistants Teaching Assistantships Teaching assistantships are available for doctoral students Appointments to teaching assistantships are on a semester basis Each semester students in the department may submit their application to be a teaching assistant In addition offers of teaching assistantships are often made at the time of admission by the admissions committee New International TAs must satisfy an oral English Assessment conducted by the University The Test of Spoken English does not substitute for this assessment A TA appointment is typically for 20 hours per week for the semester and covers the student s tuition fees and insurance Other Funding Information and assistance in searching for external fellowships grants for which graduate students may apply can be obtained from the Office of Graduate Studies https gradschool utexas edu finances fellowships externally funded Tuition and Fees The amount that each student must pay for tuition and fees depends on 2 criteria The number of hours for which the student is enrolled Typically CS graduate students take nine hours but in rare cases they may petition for approval to enroll in twelve The student s residency status Texas residents pay lower rates than do students who are international or out of state Those students who have certain graduate fellowships TA positions or RA positions are entitled to pay the Texas resident tuition rate Please see our tuition rates http tuition utexas edu rates

UT s COVID 19 testing efforts and how we re planning to approach the spring 2021 semester Proactive Community Testing The return of our student population has not resulted in wider spread throughout Austin and Travis County or increased hospitalizations The amount of confirmed positive cases is within the range of what we had expected given UT s size Our Proactive Community Testing process has been updated and streamlined If you are coming to campus we want you to get tested regularly as frequently as once every two weeks If you get tested through UT s proactive community testing program and produce a positive result you will not have to take a second test for confirmation We will soon be rolling out a new incentive program for UT community members who volunteer to get tested Spring 2021 Our plan is to structure the spring 2021 semester in much the same way as we have the current semester There will be robust online course offerings hybrid learning options and some purely in person classes The spring calendar will remain the same with spring break and other key events occurring at the same time they have in previous years We have not yet determined what commencement will look like and how much of the celebration will be in person or online 9 14 2020 Additions from Testing Before Home Football Game 1 198 students were tested for COVID 19 before Saturday s Longhorns football game with 95 testing positive and 1 103 negative Some of the positive results were people with previously reported cases already counted on our dashboard who were still testing positive but are no longer infectious which is a known result with some tests 69 new results are being added to our COVID 19 dashboard 9 9 2020 Cluster Announcement University Health Services UT Health Austin and Austin Public Health are actively conducting contact tracing as a result of three clusters that collectively have approximately 100 positive cases of COVID 19 in the West Campus area The individuals in these clusters are currently isolating and receiving necessary medical attention Austin Public Health and UT Health Austin are working to identify additional potential exposures The university s contact tracing team is communicating directly with anyone determined to have been in close contact with a positive individual This is defined as someone who was within six feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes starting from two days before illness onset or for asymptomatic patients two days prior to specimen collection until the time the patient is isolated The university is committed to providing community members with relevant information about significant clusters that pose health and safety risks so they can make informed and healthy decisions in their daily lives The university cannot broadly communicate details about individual positive cases including specific addresses in compliance with applicable federal and state law If you are experiencing symptoms of COVID 19 which include fever shortness of breath muscle aches or a cough please immediately contact your medical provider University Health Services UHS students only or UT Health Austin staff faculty and

Testing and Plans for the Fall from Interim President Jay Hartzell On Wednesday the fall semester officially begins So many members of our university community have worked tirelessly to get us to this point but I know a great deal of uncertainty still looms as we aim to carry forward our vital learning teaching and research missions during these difficult times Here are a few reminders While those employees who are able to work effectively from home will continue to do so those who are working from campus can find needed information in our employee guidebook available in English and Spanish Campus events will be generally limited to 10 participants The university has been carrying out proactive community COVID 19 tests in addition to the more than 1 300 tests previously administered throughout the summer By testing widely during these early days we will develop a better understanding of the baseline COVID 19 rates within our community and be in a stronger position to limit spread and provide care You will be able to track case numbers during the semester via our COVID 19 dashboard And you will be able to see information about significant clusters here 8 20 2020 More Plans for the Fall Semester from Interim President Jay Hartzell Next week our community will reignite the learning teaching and research that makes The University of Texas so special Here are some updates on additional plans and resources for the fall semester and some of the efforts we re making to keep our students staff and faculty safe Many students have chosen to learn fully online this fall 76 of the seats taken this semester will be for courses that are completely online another 19 are for hybrid classes that combine online elements with in person elements and only about 5 are fully in person We officially released the Protect Texas Together App for students faculty and staff The app is available to download here All students faculty and staff will be required to complete an online interactive training program called Staying Healthy in a Changing Environment While not directly related to COVID 19 safety enhancements made on and off campus in recent years remain in place and will be expanded as we move forward 8 4 2020 COVID 19 Testing for Fall Semester from Interim President Jay Hartzell Robust and rigorous testing will be needed to monitor and limit the presence of COVID 19 on our campus and keep our community members as safe as possible as we continue to navigate the pandemic Here are some of the key elements of our strategy Working in collaboration with epidemiologists infectious disease experts and other health care professionals our strategic approach to COVID 19 testing consists of three components testing for individuals who are ill contact tracing and proactive community testing We will have the capacity to test hundreds of symptomatic students each day using in house labs We have a goal of proactively testing up to 5 000 UT community members each week for COVID 19 using a strategic scientific based approach The university through an agreement between Dell Medical School and Austin Public Health will continue to conduct contact tracing for university community members who test positive for COVID 19 7 7 2020 UT Staff Member Dies from COVID 19 from Interim President Jay Hartzell 6 17 2020 Fall 2020 Planning Update 6 17 from Interim President Jay Hartzell As a university we are continuing to use all of the talent on our campus as well as the guidance of epidemiologists and other medical experts to finalize a strategy for the upcoming fall semester We will be finalizing all of our major fall plans at the end of June A new complete website that will contain all of the primary information that students families faculty and staff need to know will be shared when it is live The university is developing an agreement that allows Austin Public Health to contract with Dell Medical School to conduct contact tracing for UT community members who test positive for COVID 19 when we reopen The current prohibition on university sanctioned travel for business or study has been extended through July 31 6 12 2020 Fall 2020 Planning Update 6 12 from Interim President Jay Hartzell As we continue to develop a plan for our employees return to campus we are laser focused on both the health of our community members and our vital education and research missions Currently there is no specific day or time for staff to begin returning to campus We expect employees return to campus to be gradual and phased based on the needs of individual offices and employees Supervisors will assess specific health needs of employees as they make decisions and we will continue to monitor local school district plans and child care restarts since many staff members have children also facing uncertain schedules Once we get past the immediate hurdles for reopening in the fall we will also more fully consider different long term options for teleworking and flexible schedules for UT employees 6 10 2020 COVID 19 Identified at the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center You can find updates from the Wildflower Center about this situation here 6

2020 Planning Update 5 20 from President Gregory L Fenves and Interim President Designate Jay Hartzell Fall Semester Schedule The fall semester will begin as scheduled on August 26 and classes will run until Thanksgiving Students will not return after Thanksgiving and instead will participate in reading days and final exams remotely With COVID 19 still expected to be active this fall we hope to avoid the possibility of students becoming infected during the Thanksgiving break and then spreading the virus to classmates upon their return after Thanksgiving We are still developing the details for how this new schedule will affect course syllabi residence hall living and other key campus functions We will continue to provide additional information as we move forward In person Commencement Ceremonies Since students will not be returning to campus after Thanksgiving all in person commencement ceremonies for the fall semester will be postponed This is another difficult but critical decision given the continued risks associated with the spread of COVID 19 Our planned in person university wide commencement ceremony for the Class of 2020 will take place on campus at some point in 2021 Spring and fall 2020 graduates will be invited to this in person celebration The date and plans for this event will depend on the evolving COVID 19 situation and we will update our graduates as soon as we have a clear sense of when we can host all of them safely We thank our 2020 graduates for their understanding and flexibility as we work to provide them with a celebration that is fitting of their extraordinary achievements 5 19 2020 Second Phase of Financial Mitigation Measures from President Gregory L Fenves and Interim President Designate Jay Hartzell Leadership is grateful for the hard work of Faculty and Staff since the COVID 19 Crisis began for us in March We ve experienced both increased costs due to the shifts in how we are teaching and are facing declines in expected

merit pool Limited new hires Limited large expenditures to only essential needs Now we are moving to second phase Revenue generating units will now be directed to develop new financial plans with the Provost and CFO s offices to contain costs where needed Furloughs or permanent reductions in force will be likely for specific units where revenues have declined Will likely include furloughs or permanent reductions in force Additional information will be provided by departmental leadership to staff members Emergency leave was extended but starting June 1 emergency leave will no longer be an

Foundation for Mental Health shares advice on cultivating resilience during a pandemic By Rebecca Lee Salazar In 2020 it s understandable to feel knocked down And although getting back up and moving forward may not always seem easy taking steps to increase your resilience can help you through the process But what is resilience exactly Oftentimes we are not aware of how resilient we can be until we encounter change or experience a traumatic event says Dr Octavio N Martinez Jr executive director of the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health at The University of Texas at Austin He defines resilience as the ability to adapt to and or recover from change or misfortune without long term negative effects Although some people may appear naturally resilient the ability to bounce back Martinez says is actually a skill you can improve upon Our personality characteristics play a role in our resiliency but it is the quality of our life experiences and especially the quality of our close relationships that determine how truly resilient we are For many people across the globe the coronavirus pandemic has affected them physically financially mentally and emotionally If you have been feeling the stresses of the pandemic Martinez offers these tips to help you move through these tough times and start building your resilience 1 Expand your social network and improve the quality of your relationships Humans are emotional social beings and the quality of our relationships is one of the most important factors in building resilience Spend some time reflecting on the number and strength of your current social connections It s ideal to expand your social network so you have multiple friends family members neighbors and co workers whom you can reach out to for support and connection Work to improve your relationships by staying socially connected while social distancing 2 Accomplish a small task every day Human beings need to feel as if they have a purpose Depending on your values create small goals that you can accomplish every day This can be as simple as making your bed every morning reading a few pages of a book before bed or scheduling a call with a loved one every week By completing these small tasks you start improving your ability to get things done and it helps prepare you for greater complex tasks 3 Take care of yourself the same way you take care of others It s important to remember that the best way to take care of another person is by taking care of yourself first The mind and body are intricately connected By maintaining good mental and physical health through regular exercise good sleep habits nutrition and relaxation techniques you are becoming stronger and more resilient and are able to take care of yourself and others much more easily 4 Practice self reflection Take some time to think about what has worked and what has not worked for you when you have been confronted with change or adversity Be honest with yourself and identify triggers and behaviors that have raised red flags within yourself For example think about what activities events and experiences have triggered you emotionally What were the emotions that resulted and how did you respond Keep in mind that all behavior serves a purpose Figuring out whether your reactions and behaviors were beneficial or detrimental can help you improve the outcomes for the next time you re faced with a challenge 5 Plan for what you can It s impossible to plan for every change or situation that may arise but identifying some likely scenarios and developing responses can help ease your mind and make you feel better equipped for the next time an actual emergency or change happens As part of this process identify and list resources that can support you in various scenarios Copy

Connect Nov 01 2020 Voces Oral History Center documents how Latino community is being affected by COVID 19 By Sabrina LeBoeuf Ram n Galindo recounts his battlefield experiences during World War II with Maggie Rivas Rodriguez at his Austin home in 2010 The Voces oral historians have had to change their interview methods during the pandemic Photo courtesy of Voces Since 1999 the Voces Oral History Center in the Moody College of Communication has been documenting the voices and stories of the Latino community The project began by recording the stories of World War II veterans and the civilians who witnessed that era before moving on to create more collections centered on the wars in Korea and Vietnam Then March 2020 rolled around The coronavirus started dominating headlines especially once the World Health Organization declared the virus to be a pandemic on March 11 By the end of the month Maggie Rivas Rodriguez the founder and director of the Voces project decided this was a topic worth pursuing They would call the new collection Voces of a Pandemic For the first time they were going to document history as it was unfolding Up until now the interviews that we ve done it s been people talking about the past what their lives were like Rivas Rodriguez says This is the first time that we are looking at how people are living and I think it s really incumbent on us to capture that because we want to make sure that when the history is written about the pandemic Latinos and Latinas are included in that history Rivas Rodriguez knows that the historical records of past major events do not generally include stories from the Latino community It s why she started the Voces project In 1992 while trying to write a magazine article Rivas Rodriguez says she could not find any books on Mexican Americans in the World War II generation For the project s first 10 years she sought to make up for this lack by collecting oral history interviews from across the country The Latino experience with COVID 19 is getting more attention The Los Angeles Times The New York Times and other news outlets have published articles about how the community is disproportionately affected by the pandemic There wouldn t be an issue finding stories for the Voces project but there would be new training to incorporate 10 universities and one nonprofit group as partners There was also the transition from previous interviewing practices to using Zoom Andr s Torres a videographer and audiovisual coordinator for Voces led the training effort to make sure people s life stories were filmed with appropriate lighting and clear sound Teaching all these academics journalists or people conducting interviews for us to show them how to do it was a little bit crazy and difficult says Torres who earned an MFA in filmmaking at The University of Texas But it s also interesting because all these people now are trained to do oral history interviews which is great With more interviewers across the country comes more interview subjects As of mid October at least 91 interviews had been completed with many more subjects waiting their turn This is the first time that we are looking at how people are living and I think it s really incumbent on us to capture that Maggie Rivas Rodriguez Vincent Pe a a doctoral student and graduate research assistant for Voces of the Pandemic says the interviewers looked for subjects by starting with their friends and families Pe a interviewed his aunt and her partner When he interviewed his brother he says he learned much more beyond the rants they usually shared about the coronavirus We talk about this pandemic all the time but not in such a way that is outlining all the various ways that affects you Pe a says We just vent to each other and that s not the same as being asked Hey how does the coronavirus impact your day to day life Not all interviews have taken place online On the Fourth of July Torres drove to Fort Worth to meet Diego Nevarez a Mexican American teenager who was an actor in Torres films He was throwing a farewell party before leaving to join the Army and Torres wanted to document his experience even if Nevarez was not negatively affected by COVID 19 For me it was important to get that document for Voces but also how does it look for a Mexican American first generation teenage boy who is about to join the Army How does it look joining the Army in a pandemic Torres says The project has yet to fully analyze the interviews to address trends within the research Nonetheless Pe a has noticed patterns Latinos and Latinas did not seem to understand the gravity of the pandemic partially due to lack of outreach he says If you went to H E B at the height of it when everyone was hoarding the toilet paper H E B was packed with a line out the door Pe a says If you went across the street on I 35 to the Fiesta the Fiesta was like a normal day No one s masked up Through the interviews Pe a also says he s seen the collision of two major historical events as subjects discuss how recent protests against police brutality relate to them Rivas Rodriguez says there are so many topics to cover within documenting the pandemic whether it be the political process Black Lives Matter or the economy Interviews need to be uploaded transcribed and indexed and several of them are at least an hour long With Torres using equipment from home instead of on campus the uploading process takes longer than usual he says But he doesn t mind It s worth his time Even though it s hard because it s not just this recording of people talking it makes me hopeful that if people see us and if we see each other we can be able to be better evolve and make changes and in our society as human beings Torres says Copy link Email

to customize the content of that page and make it easier to find Individual data gathered through a specific process such as the submission of an application to attend the University related submissions and subsequent interaction with admissions staff will only be used for its intended purpose such as the consideration of an applicant for admission or an employment decision or for certain archiving research or statistical purposes described below Personal information may also come from third parties that are authorized to provide personal information to the University The University may use personal data it collects for a specific purpose and further process that personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest scientific or historical research purposes or statistical

often used to remember information about preferences and pages a person has visited For example when a person visits some sites on the University Web they might see a Welcome Back message The first time the person visited the site a cookie was probably set on their computer when they return the cookie is read again A person can configure their web browser to refuse to accept cookies to disable cookies and to remove cookies from their hard drive as needed University Web servers use cookies in the centralized authentication system called UT EID The University uses these cookies so that users will not have to repeatedly enter user names and passwords when they go to different parts of the University Web Normally a person is required to enter a UT EID when they request data about themselves or to ensure that they are a member of the University community For example students who want to check their admission status or staff members who complete time sheets must enter their UT EID so the system knows who is requesting the data This login process uses Secure Sockets Layer SSL so the user name and password are encrypted between the Web browser and our Web server Some Web Servers may also use cookies to retain user preference information It is against university policy to share this information with external third parties 8 Third party content on UT Websites Some pages within the utexas edu domain may contain content that is served from external third parties For example a utexas edu web site might include a graphic logo or a script from a third party Specifically the following code within a utexas edu page would represent an example of third party content img src 3Ca 20href 3D http www other org com logo gif http www other org com logo gif alt Sample In this example logo gif would be third party content served from a web server outside the utexas edu domain www other org com in this case Third party content in utexas edu is not limited to graphics but this is the most frequent use The University does not transmit any information to these third parties as part of such requests However when a person visits utexas edu pages that contain third party content information such as their IP address date browser and requested page is transmitted from your computer to that third party 9 Grounds for Processing Personal Data and How It is Used by the

AI Institute Focused on Machine Learning Submitted by Anonymous on Wed 08 26 2020 8 00am The National Science Foundation has selected The University of Texas at Austin to lead NSF AI Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning bolstering the university s existing strengths in this emerging field Machine learning is the technology that drives AI systems enabling them to acquire knowledge and make predictions in complex environments This technology has the potential to transform everything from transportation to entertainment to health care UT Austin already among the world s top universities for artificial intelligence is poised to develop entirely new classes of algorithms that will lead to more sophisticated and beneficial AI technologies The university will lead a larger team of researchers that includes the University of Washington Wichita State University and Microsoft Research This is another important step in our university s ascension as a world leader in machine learning and tech innovation as a whole and I am grateful to the National Science Foundation for their profound support said UT Austin interim President Jay Hartzell Many of the world s greatest problems and challenges can be solved with the assistance of artificial intelligence and it s only fitting given UT s history of accomplishment in this area along with the booming tech sector in Austin that this new NSF institute be housed right here on the Forty Acres UT Austin is simultaneously establishing a permanent base for campuswide machine learning research called the Machine Learning Laboratory It will house the new AI institute and bring together computer and data scientists mathematicians roboticists engineers and ethicists to meet the institute s research goals while also working collaboratively on other interdisciplinary projects Computer science professor Adam Klivans who led the effort to win the NSF AI institute competition will direct both the new institute and the Machine Learning Lab Alex Dimakis associate professor of electrical and computer engineering will serve as the AI institute s co director Machine learning enables machines to find patterns in large sets of data Already it powers many technologies we use every day such as web search engines voice assistants social media feeds and recommendation systems for music and movies Now researchers are looking to apply machine learning to more complex problems and exploring how to design machine learning innovations that transform industries in ways that align with human needs Machine learning can be used to predict which of thousands of recently formulated drugs might be most effective as a COVID 19 therapeutic bypassing exhaustive laboratory trial and error Klivans said Modern datasets however are often diffuse or noisy and tend to confound current techniques Our AI institute will dig deep into the foundations of machine learning so that new AI systems will be robust to these challenges Additionally many advanced AI applications are limited by computational constraints For example algorithms designed to help machines recognize categorize and label images can t keep up with the massive amount of video data that people upload to the internet every day and advances in this field could have implications across multiple industries Machine learning has seeped into practically every area of science and industry from video processing to drug design to finance to physical simulations said Klivans A key mission will be to develop core technologies that can break through obstacles common to all of these areas Dimakis notes that algorithms will be designed to train video models efficiently For example Facebook one of the AI institute s industry partners is interested in using these algorithms to make its platform more accessible to people with visual impairments And in a partnership with Dell Medical School AI institute researchers will test these algorithms to expedite turnaround time for medical imaging diagnostics possibly reducing the time it takes for patients to get critical assessments and treatment The NSF is investing more than 100 million in five new AI institutes nationwide including the 20 million project based at UT Austin to advance the foundations of machine learning In addition to Facebook Netflix YouTube Dell Technologies and the city of Austin have signed on to transfer this research into practice Karen Willcox is director of the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences and a professor of aerospace engineering and engineering mechanics at UT Austin She writes Machine learning represents an increasingly important aspect of our research agenda in computational science which at its core develops mathematical models and simulations to understand physical and natural systems We are very pleased to have Oden Institute researchers playing a significant role in the MLL effort aiming to bring together the power of physics based modeling with data driven learning The institute will also pursue the creation of an online master s degree in AI along with undergraduate research programming and online AI courses for high schoolers and working professionals Austin based tech entrepreneurs Amir Husain founder and CEO of SparkCognition an Austin based artificial intelligence company and Zaib Husain founder of Makerarm a company that produces a robotic arm system for manufacturing are supporting the new Machine Learning Laboratory with a generous donation of 5 million to sustain its long term mission of the Machine Learning Laboratory Helping advance the science of AI and machine learning is deeply meaningful to both of us the Husains wrote in a joint statement For decades UT has been a leader in computer science research and specifically in artificial intelligence The knowledge representation genetic algorithms and related advancements that have come out of the Department of Computer Science have informed Amir s entrepreneurial journey The university s strengths in computer science engineering public policy business and law can help drive applications of AI Amir Husain said And Austin s booming tech scene is destined to be a major driver for the local and national economy for decades to come The Machine Learning Laboratory is based in the Department of Computer Science and is a collaboration among faculty researchers and students from across the university including Texas Computing Texas Robotics the Department of Statistics and Data Sciences the Department of Mathematics

Continuity and working from home You are hereHome Mission Accomplished Submitted by Anonymous on Thu 11 05 2020 2 57pm UT Austin is committed to working with the U S military to identify and prioritize research that can quickly be adapted to help protect and defend the nation s interest A methodical voice tells the watching crowd I am going to remove the lid Everyone is quiet as a robot using artificial intelligence AI opens a trash can and lifts out a bag Students and researchers hold their breath as it navigates across the floor of a mock house avoiding obstacles to its destination Mission accomplished it says The trash has been taken out and the audience applauds This is a huge achievement for the robot designed by a Texas Robotics team for the 2019 RoboCup competition It may seem like a lot of fanfare for a basic chore but it is a complicated task for a machine The robot demonstrated autonomy and communication skills in a changing environment key interests for artificial intelligence experts right now and the U S military Related research could help future service robots go beyond taking out the trash to assisting and performing dangerous tasks keeping soldiers out of harm s way That is why The University of Texas at Austin is proudly partnering with the Army Futures Command a new four star command that is transforming Army modernization Together they are putting useful research into practice on the battlefield more quickly The partnership is a commitment to identify and further early research and development that has the ability to transition rapidly getting new technology quickly to the hands of those who need it The challenges are huge says Justin Hart assistant director of Texas Robotics and an assistant professor of practice with the Department of Computer Science involved in research with the Army Futures Command Hart is an expert on semantic mapping autonomous human robot interaction and artificial intelligence for service robots Multi tasking autonomous AI robots are the holy grail of his field We are doing fundamental research that has the ability to be applied to solve problems We want to ensure there is a pipeline that makes that research available in a usable format THE GOAL IS FOR THE ROBOTS TO ALWAYS BE ON AND DEALING WITH WHATEVER COMES THEIR WAY THAT IS A GRAND CHALLENGE FOR ROBOTICS Peter Stone The computing and engineering challenges have vast game changing potential for how robots could be deployed in several areas Texas Robotics a robust consortium of interdisciplinary researchers led by the College of Natural Sciences and Cockrell School of Engineering is working to advance the field Texas Robotics collaborative projects explore robotics numerous application spaces including social surgical rehabilitation vehicles drilling manufacturing space nuclear and defense Peter Stone director of Texas Robotics principal investigator for UT Austin s robotics research with the Army Futures Command and prominent AI expert on machine learning and dynamic environments says the university is focusing on two major growth areas The first is long term autonomy the ability for robots to operate self sufficiently for hours or days rather than seconds or minutes The second is human robot interaction that includes autonomous robots that are interacting with people in an unstructured environment This requires the robot to have the ability to respond to and communicate with humans whether in a health care setting on the street or during a mission The goal is for the robots to always be on and dealing with whatever comes their way says Stone That is a grand challenge for robotics Centralizing these efforts makes UT Austin an attractive full service robotics group for industry and government partners Stone says Over the past five or six years we have banded together and formed an interdisciplinary group that has an educational component and that has an industry affiliates program We can explore a lot of synergies across a lot of different perspectives Historically getting new technologies to the soldiers has been a slow process The Army Futures Command s mission is to modernize and speed up that process and Forge the Future In 2018 the Army selected Austin Texas as the headquarters for the command after considering cities across the country The city stood out as an ideal location because of its combination of high tech and science related industries the state government and the academic reach of UT Austin UT s location in the technological hub that is Austin our status of having a top five ranked program in AI and our leadership on a brand new artificial intelligence institute funded by the National Science Foundation help show that our friends in the military selected its robotics research partner wisely in picking UT says Paul Goldbart dean of the College of Natural Sciences Innovation has been happening in the government and in leading research universities for decades says Sharon L Wood dean of the Cockrell School of Engineering But now that we re working together to address specific challenges we can expand our resources and accelerate the speed at which we roll out new technologies This is a win win for both UT Austin and the U S Army Today UT Austin remains fully committed to discovery and advancing the research that could help the world A keystone project in the Army Futures Command partnership is the newly renovated Anna Hiss Gymnasium the centralized home for Texas Robotics The new space is both a research lab and public showcase for all the robotics on campus The university committed to building the space last year The lab benefits the larger robotics program and the military partnership as a hub for cross disciplinary collaborative research The ribbon cutting ceremony for the lab was held Oct 2 2020 with special guest speakers Gov Greg Abbott Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy and UT Austin President Jay Hartzell Texas is ground zero for the next generation of cybersecurity artificial intelligence robotics and all these different strategies that will not only be advancing the United States Army but will be advancing the next level of technology across the entire globe with Austin being the centerpiece of it said Gov Abbott TEXAS IS GROUND ZERO FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF CYBERSECURITY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND ROBOTICS Gov Greg Abbott Our commitment to the Army knows no bounds said President Hartzell at the ribbon cutting We are a world class partner and destination for the military veterans and their families The university s dedication starts right from the leadership at the top all the way down to the research assistants carrying out the projects says Seth Wilk director of the UT Austin Liaison Office to the Army Futures Command Partnering with the military helps foster collaboration with government and industry and it supports impactful academic research Stone notes having the military involvement is incredibly useful for research inspiration and creates a path to impact A few Army employees are working on campus and embedded in the partner projects from the beginning to help make it more efficient and effective In addition to autonomous robotics the Army s priorities include improving navigation next generation vehicles such as self driving cars and vertical lift aircraft material development and synthetic training environments While other institutions are feeling pressure to pull back in these uncertain times UT Austin remains committed We understand that just as critical technologies have allowed for productivity connection and engagement amid a pandemic we must ensure future technologies are there when we need them too says Goldbart This requires providing researchers with opportunities to solve today s intellectual puzzles and bring about profound and positive breakthroughs to help society address and overcome future challenges Cross posted

Vice President for Research announced plans to allow some forms of human subjects research to resume on campus and to increase the workforce density cap to 50 beginning September 23 The increase on workforce density applies not only to human subjects research but to all research groups currently authorized to conduct on campus research under RL3 Read the full announcement here Additionally the Office of the Vice President of Research announced that beginning October 14 2020 undergraduate students may resume on campus research with the approval of their supervising Research Level 3 approved principal investigator PI Please note that these announcements apply only to investigators who are RL3 approved If you are not currently approved please follow the instructions below to apply for RL3 approval REQUEST RL3 APPROVAL If you are NOT currently approved for RL3 activity email CNS SRI austin utexas edu for information about submitting a RL3 request ADJUST YOUR COHORT COMPOSITION If you are currently approved for RL3 activity but need to adjust your cohort composition including adding undergraduates please email CNS SRI austin utexas edu to receive a link to revise your cohort selection If you decide to reorganize the personnel in your cohorts any researchers reassigned or added to an existing cohort must quarantine themselves for 10 days prior to returning to campus in their new cohort All researchers in the same building or complex will need to follow the same cohort schedule This applies even if you do not wish to bring back additional members of your group and instead choose to maintain your lab as a single cohort at less than 50 workforce density Cohort model details and schedule for your building are available on the CNS Cohort Models webpage RL3 caps the Workforce Number at 50 of the total research workforce which refers to the maximum allowable percentage of researchers on site Visit the Research Restart FAQs page link below for clarification on calculating your Workforce Number Please do not resume projects that cannot be stopped again on short notice We should anticipate the possibility of returning to more restricted research levels should COVID 19 infections rise again Refer to the steps links and resources below to learn more about research activities permitted in this level and to find useful templates for resuming research in your

attestation survey has been retired The Protect Texas Together app is designed to help individuals track their symptoms each day and based on those symptoms indicate whether they are cleared to come to campus While completely voluntary use of the app is strongly encouraged for anyone coming to campus Here s some information about how the Protect Texas Together App works Users can track their symptoms each day with the app which can provide a daily campus pass for those without any major COVID 19 symptoms If the app s algorithm determines that an individual may have COVID 19 based on the symptoms that person selected the app will decline to provide a pass and instead direct the user to contact either University Health Services or UT Health Austin for guidance or testing Faculty and staff members can also go to the provider of their choice Beyond daily symptom screening the app allows users to easily and quickly log in and out of campus rooms for contact tracing purposes access local COVID 19 information and resources and connect their EID to a proactive community test ID should they volunteer for asymptomatic testing The Room Check In and History function will be used for contact tracing purposes in case there is an outbreak in your building and we urge you and your staff to use it throughout the day This is especially important for the common spaces shared among different labs core facilities instrument rooms stockrooms etc For those without a smartphone a phone based survey application is also available by dialing 800 325 8903 This uses the same algorithm as the app to indicate whether a person is safe to come to campus but works on any phone The phone based survey requires a unique access code which is available here Those without internet access or in need of further assistance should call the UT Service Desk at 512 475 9400 Campus visitors without EIDs can use this symptom monitoring app developed by the CDC if they wish community PROTECT TEXAS

Assessments Active Learning Backward Design Educational Technology Experiential Learning Inclusive Teaching UGTAs Lesson Planning Problem Based Learning Teamwork Home Research on how people learn shows that teaching using active learning is more effective than just lecturing Students in STEM courses where instructors use active learning do better on exams and tests specifically designed to measure conceptual understanding Students in active learning courses are also less likely to fail or withdraw This is especially true for students from backgrounds that are underrepresented in STEM subjects or who are first in their families to go to college What is active learning Active learning is when the instructor stops talking and students make progress toward a learning objective by actively doing something such as working on a problem in a small group or using clickers to answer a conceptual question There is an abundance of research on the effectiveness of active learning two recent meta analyses published in highly respected journals show this Freeman and colleagues 2014 analyzed 225 STEM education studies and found that students in active learning courses perform better on exams show greater gains in conceptual understanding and are less likely to fail or withdraw Ruiz Primo and colleagues 2011 analyzed 310 STEM education studies and found positive effects across STEM disciplines This site is designed to point out practical evidence based resources for teaching using active learning Please email any feedback or suggestions for other topics to tides cns utexas edu How does it work How does it work To be effective instruction must Actively involve students in a learning task Aim for an outcome or objective Provide structure and opportunities for practice Offer opportunities for feedback Encourage interaction and reflection Expect higher level thinking not just recall Be informed with evidence of student learning and development and Include well motivated and well timed explanations from reading or mini lectures See these references for more details How People Learn Discipline Based Education Research We must teach more effectively here are four ways to get started Reaching Students What does it look like What does it look like Because students are actively engaging in learning course material by thinking writing talking and reflecting active learning classrooms will be visibly active and noisy Students are likely to be facing one another or the whole class discussing how they are approaching a problem or their rationale for selecting a particular solution The instructor is likely to be moving around the classroom checking on students progress listening to their ideas and giving them feedback both verbally and by modeling how to go about solving a problem or asking students to model problem solving for one another Students will be practicing what they will be expected to do to be successful on exams or other assessments Learn more Learn more The following are repositories of high quality undergraduate STEM education materials and guidance Science Education Resource Center at Carleton College Center for

2020 Texas Coronavirus Scientists Win Award for Research with Great Societal Benefit AUSTIN Texas The world s largest multidisciplinary scientific society has announced that Jason McLellan a University of Texas at Austin associate professor in the Department of Molecular Biosciences and Daniel Wrapp a graduate student fellow were among seven winners of this year s Golden Goose Award Supported by members of Congress from both parties and a coalition of businesses universities and scientific societies since 2012 the prize this year went to scientists whose federally funded research has had a significant impact for the response and treatment of COVID 19 The American Association for the Advancement of Science AAAS cited winners contributions that led to the development of promising vaccines antibody treatments and other efforts to thwart COVID 19 McLellan and Wrapp received recognition for work with scientists in Belgium and elsewhere to engineer an antibody produced by llamas for use in fighting the current coronavirus The pair also collaborated with researchers at the National Institutes of Health s Vaccine Research Center to develop a stabilized spike protein now used as an antigen in many leading vaccines to fight the current coronavirus SARS CoV 2 These were two of three projects that received 2020 Golden Goose Award recognition It is the first time a scientist has received recognition in more than one Golden Goose Award These dedicated academic researchers and their colleagues provided the vital foundation that was necessary for many of the vaccines and treatments that hold great promise for humanity today said Paul Goldbart dean of UT Austin s College of Natural Sciences It is fortunate for us all that not only was the seed corn of basic research planted long ago here at The University of Texas at Austin and beyond but that these scientists have worked tirelessly all year to ensure the arrival of vaccines treatments and knowledge to curb the coronavirus crisis In this year s award announcement organizers noted that it is too soon to know the full impact of the winners groundbreaking research but recipients demonstrate how scientific advances resulting from foundational research can help respond to national and global challenges Each year the award honors scientists whose research may have sounded odd or obscure when first conducted but has since resulted in significant benefits to society The coalition that created the Golden Goose Award in 2012 did so as a counterpoint to criticisms of basic research as wasteful federal spending a notion once embodied by the so called Golden Fleece Awards given by the late Sen William Proxmire Rep Jim Cooper D Tenn who initiated the idea for the Golden Goose Award indicated that COVID 19 provides an opportunity to appreciate science and the need to ensure more scientists can do more great work to help lead our nation our world and our universe forward Two fellow winners of Golden Goose Award recognition this year Kizzmekia Corbett and Barney Graham both at the National Institutes of Health NIH s Vaccine Research Center collaborated with McLellan and Wrapp on both the stabilized spike protein work and the llama antibody research Other winners this year were Emmie de Wit and Vincent Munster at the NIH and James Crowe at the Vanderbilt Vaccine Center Honorees will be recognized at a virtual awards ceremony today at 3 p m CT McLellan who holds the Robert A Welch Chair in Chemistry and his team which includes Wrapp received federal support for the two research projects via the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy s Argonne National Laboratory State and philanthropic funding also support the team s research which requires use of the Sauer Structural Biology Laboratory a facility funded in part by the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of

the UT dance program leads a community of student dancers to bravely speak their truth through movement By Rebecca Lee Salazar Charles O Anderson has turned The University of Texas dance program into a tight knit family So much so that Anderson s students affectionately call him Dance Dad Because of this supportive environment students are empowered to share their stories through movement which Anderson says is a powerful way to make the world a better place We are always saying something through our movement he says I teach students that our bodies are remarkable tools for expression and for humanity and love Anderson s inviting and inclusive learning environment is one of the many reasons he has been awarded the Regents Outstanding Teaching Award this year While at UT Anderson has held appointments in the Department of African and African Diaspora Studies and the Department of Theatre and Dance teaching courses on African American dance history choreography Afro contemporary dance technique kinetic storytelling movement driven storytelling and more while also maintaining an active dance career Dancing Together Anderson was introduced to kinetic storytelling while growing up in Richmond Virginia Regularly attending Baptist Church with his family he was exposed to spiritual dancing and testifying from which he pulls inspiration for his courses Eclectic rigorous and lively are the adjectives Anderson uses to describe the Afro contemporary dance technique he teaches Blending contemporary dance and African derived physical practices students use floor work improvisation and unpredictable changes in rhythm and direction to grab the audience Anderson strongly emphasizes the importance of connecting in class and on stage experiences with lived experiences Doing so he says is a way dancers can enact positive change in their community So much of dance training is about separating oneself from the world in which you re living in he says But instead I want students to realize you can t separate from it you embody culture and have a responsibility to engage with the world of which you are apart One example of this is Anderson s most recent dance production Re current Unrest an immersive experience addressing systemic racism and the oppression Black Americans face He encouraged students to use their movements as a practice of social justice By adhering to UT s COVID 19 safety protocols Anderson and former and current student volunteers reenacted past and present American unrest to a global livestream audience of over 950 viewers this past October Throughout the sensory experience the performers movements were fueled with intention as they danced in synchronicity and desynchronization to the sound of composer Steven Reich s work and the narration of Anderson s voice Being able to share this experience with his students has been a highlight of his career he says To have done a professional project with my students that is being seen globally and have it recognized as professional caliber work and giving them that opportunity that s what it s all about for me It s felt like all of my worlds coming together to do something that I ve always been called to do A Platform for Compassion Although dance has always been in Anderson s life in some way many are surprised to learn he didn t take his first formal dance class until his freshman year at Cornell University Upon realizing that dance and choreography could be used as forms of expression and activism he switched his major from mechanical engineering to dance and never looked back Anderson earned an MFA in choreography from Temple University while simultaneously teaching there and starting his company dance theater X Next he taught at a private liberal arts college for seven years where he thrived yet yearned for a greater sense of community and ultimately landed a position as an associate professor of African diasporic dance at UT in 2011 A fierce advocate for his students he has always prioritized their well being This was especially apparent in April of 2016 after the tragic loss of UT dance freshman Haruka Weiser who was murdered while walking home from rehearsal As the entire dance program grappled with this immense loss Anderson reassured his students that they would move through this dark time as a community I was profoundly devastated by her death during my first year of heading the dance area I instinctively gathered the entire dance program together daily for the remainder of the semester to dance as one he wrote in a statement to the Board of Regents about his career It was a turning point for our program and for me as an educator and administrator on many levels In the following days weeks and months Anderson worked closely with the university campus police and other organizations to promote a safe campus environment including expanding the UT SURE Walk program He left his office door open to hold space for students and organized dance performances where they could move through and process their pain while honoring their classmate and friend I have had many moments of darkness in my life he told Arts Next magazine Dance puts you in your body and sometimes that s all you need to come out of your head Leading with compassion and empathy is a special quality many students say they admire about Anderson and aspire to emulate He has encouraged me to give more to the world bountifully and graciously especially in low times of anguish and heartache wrote former student Kaitlyn B Jones in her Regents Outstanding Teaching Award recommendation letter of Anderson Anderson s warm demeanor confidence quirkiness and artistic talent have made him an outstanding mentor to his students He takes seriously his position as a role model and strives to illuminate the importance behind each student s reason to dance Charles rekindles not only the how or what but the why in people says Jones He has a gift to break through people facilitating the right conversation for them to realize their purpose whether it be in dance work or in life Setting the Stage for Change He breaks through to people by meeting them where they are Early in his career he taught physics chemistry and dance at a junior high school in East Harlem where he eventually became vice principal at the age of 27 This experience he says built the foundation for his appreciation of the power of teaching and the importance of educational equity East Harlem taught me to center the experiences of first generation students students of color queer students the marginalized communities that we often don t consider when we talk about access to education and to create an environment where they know that they are being seen and cared for and are receiving the quality of education that they absolutely deserve This early lesson in his career is part of the inspiration for the transformation of UT s dance program to be more inclusive and diverse Because of his recruiting efforts the program is composed of the most diverse group of students in terms of gender and race since its inception As part of this vision Anderson also relaunched the MFA in Dance program in 2018 with a redesigned curriculum I shifted the focus to social justice because I was seeing so many young dancers who had graduated from college but did not have the place to continue to hone their skills around these themes he says Training and inspiring the next generation of dancers and choreographers committed to social justice is part of the legacy Anderson hopes to leave at UT In response to winning the Regents Outstanding Teaching Award he says I m so grateful for the support I ve received here to be able to do this because I didn t do it alone Part of why I came here is because what starts here changes the world and I ve been fortunate enough to be able to do that in my own way with my students and colleagues Copy link Email Share Link Twitter Share Link

Others Succeed by Making Anti Fraud Systems More Accessible Submitted by Valeria Sixtos on Tue 12 01 2020 1 49pm Alumnus Greg Kuhlmann was introduced to computers and programming by his family at a young age During Kuhlmann s childhood his grandfather taught him how to program on his VIC 20 when he was just six years old and his father would take him to Amiga Users Group meetings The ability offered by programming to change bits of code and see a new outcome right before his eyes was what really drew Kuhlmann in Unbeknownst to him he would go on to earn a graduate degree in computer science and start his own cybersecurity startup During his undergraduate studies at UCLA Kuhlmann became particularly interested in artificial intelligence automated theorem and areas of math which he had never encountered before This solidified the decision to continue his studies at The University of Texas at Austin which was spurred on by the Department of Computer Science s national ranking and the fact that he completely fell in love with Austin s lush and green cityscape As a graduate student Kuhlmann worked with Vladimir Lifschitz in his first year and then with Peter Stone for the remainder of his time at UT Kuhlmann worked as a lead scientist for 21st Century Technologies where he applied machine learning and intelligent agent techniques to unmanned systems and data mining problems While pursuing his PhD at UT Kuhlmann was also involved with the Austin Villa Robot Soccer Team which he has fond memories of He recalls the long nights spent working on the robots and the solidarity between him and his teammates that arose from them At two o clock in the morning you finally get it to work and you just feel such a bond with your fellow teammates that you ve been working on this thing together Nothing brings people together more than this sort of common struggle The idea of helping individuals remained a driving point in Kuhlmann s life upon receiving his PhD He worked as a data scientist at Apple for 9 years where the importance of both personal and professional connections was solidified for him You re helping these millions of people you re saving this company millions of dollars you re bringing a better customer experience to hundreds of millions of people and those numbers just feel too abstract Kuhlmann said He says that the thing that brought him the most satisfaction was being able to help people not just the big companies and corporations I realized that the thing I contributed that day made their life a little bit easier Kuhlmann said Now Kuhlmann is the Co Founder and CEO of Sumatra his Austin based self funded startup that provides Anti Fraud and Trust Safety as a Service He was inspired to start his company after realizing that sophisticated anti fraud systems used at big companies like Uber Apple and Facebook aren t widely available to smaller companies that could benefit just as much from them He saw those big companies go to conferences and talk about their sophisticated anti fraud systems But none of these systems are actually available more widely You realize that most of what is going on out there in the world is not just those big players Kuhlmann said He decided to step in and help bridge that gap At his startup Kuhlmann is able to continue utilizing both the teamwork and technical skills he was able to hone during his time at TXCS His expertise in data science and operations help companies at the next tier avoid scammers bullying harassment and all the different kinds of things that can happen in an ecosystem that makes for a bad customer experience His vision is to work with his team to assist these smaller companies succeed at a level that is traditionally reserved for the big names in tech His passion for helping people and smaller companies at a closer level continues to thrive within his vision for a future in which anti fraud systems are more widely available and accessible Currently his team is working to build the tools that will aid smaller companies to avoid fraud with an emphasis on anti fraud education and instruction The team realized that these tools are only as effective as people knowing how to use them Now we re at this point moving forward and we re adding a new element to it which is the training part of it as well So to really democratize this idea of trust and safety data science we need both better tooling and better training And that s what we re trying to bring together now Kuhlmann said As for what the future holds Kuhlmann plans on doing what he is passionate about for as long as possible In true data scientist wording he wants to make sure he s doing whatever he s doing 1 better every day and then taking advantage of the compound interest of that Whether it is at a personal level or at a corporate level Kuhlmann wants to help the people and projects he cares about to succeed News categories AlumniTags Alumnistartupsentrepreneurship Add

environment for everyone and does not tolerate hazing by any group or individual affiliated with the University UT students should expect all student organizations to treat them with respect and dignity Hazing has no place in the Longhorn experience or student organization culture Hazing Myths vs Facts If someone agrees to participate in an activity it can t be considered hazing Under state law and UT policy the fact that a person consented to a hazing activity is not a defense The peer pressure and desire to belong in a student organization can create a coercive environment where true consent cannot be given A little hazing should be okay as long as there s no mean spirited or harmful intent Hazing is illegal under Texas state law and violates University policy It does not become okay legal or permissible if no harm is intended Hazing builds unity among new members Engaging in unlawful behavior is not the way to build unity In fact 94 4 of UT students believe that they do not need to be hazed to feel like they belong to a group Hazing is okay as long as it is not physically dangerous Hazing is not just dangerous because it can cause physical harm Hazing can also cause mental and emotional distress both to the person hazing and the one being hazed 90 5 of UT students believe that hazing is a problem because it can cause emotional harm Hazing only exists in sororities and fraternities Hazing incidents can happen in any club or student organization including athletic teams ROTC military associations performing arts groups faith based organizations and student government What is Hazing Hazing as defined in the Prohibition of Hazing means any intentional knowing or reckless act occurring on or off of the campus of an educational institution by one

the public are free to engage in expressive speech on public university campuses by converting some parts of campuses to traditional public forums instead of limited public forums It also contains

regardless of a speaker s viewpoint The new law requires universities to create disciplinary sanctions for students student organizations and faculty members who interfere with the free speech activities of others UT policy also provides for the discipline of staff if they violate the new law s provisions The law effective Sept 1 2019 gives universities until Aug 1 2020 to finalize specific rules for implementation The interim policies and procedures that UT Austin has introduced at this time will be finalized and recommended for approval by the UT System Board of Regents in 2020 How does this law affect UT The law converts the university s common outdoor area to traditional public forums and allows anyone not just students faculty members or invited guests to exercise free speech there as long as their activities are lawful and don t disrupt the functions of the campus Not all outdoor spaces on campus are part of the common outdoor area The university has defined common outdoor area in its rules What is the common outdoor area The common outdoor area means much of the open outdoor space on campus It does not include the outdoor campus space that is used for educational or research functions or for university events on either a permanent or temporary basis If an area is in the common outdoor area is it always available for use by anyone for expressive activities A person or group does not need a reservation for the exercise of expressive activities in the common outdoor area and spontaneous expressive activity may occur in areas that are not in use However once a person or group does reserve a certain space in the common outdoor area for expressive activities it is not available for another person or group s use or reservation at that time In addition when outdoor space is being used even on a temporary basis for university business or events an educational or research function it is not part of the common outdoor area available for use for others expressive activities Link to rule defining common outdoor area 13 104 2 This may include some athletic competitions and cultural activities How does this affect football Saturdays On Texas football game days portions of the university around Darrell K Royal Texas Memorial Stadium are reserved specifically for this university event and are not part of the common outdoor areas available for expressive activities However other parts of the campus outdoor area may be available for expressive activities during those events At other times when no university event is taking place in that space those same areas are available for use as part of the common outdoor area Are there outdoor spaces that are never part of the common outdoor area Yes For example the Blanton Museum of Art maintains an outdoor plaza and art garden that is a seamless part of the museum visitor experience This area includes installations and visual separation via landscaping from the common outdoor area Also some of the university s buildings and residence halls have patio areas that are reserved for residents use The courtyard areas of Goldsmith Hall and Cronkite Plaza and the patio areas outside the Texas Union and Powers Student Activity Center are considered extensions of those buildings and are not part of the common outdoor area Are the new UT Austin rules stronger protections for freedom of speech than the old UT Austin rules UT Austin has always protected free speech with members of the campus community and invited guests sharing a wide range of opinions and the robust exchange of ideas taking place in classrooms The strength of these protections remains the same and stem from the First Amendment of the U S Constitution They now extend to members of the general public who are permitted to come to the common outdoor spaces of the campus without being invited by a campus organization or affiliate What if someone is offended by another person s speech Freedom of speech means that all views have a place for expression even those that others may find offensive hurtful or wrong UT community members who hear words they don t like are free to offer their own words in response but they must always respect the rights of all speakers to share their views What if someone feels physically threatened If anyone believes they face violence or imminent bodily harm in any situation the first action should always be to call 911 and engage UTPD Can anyone come on campus to share their beliefs Yes as long as their activities are lawful and don t disrupt the functions of the campus All university rules regarding the time place and manner of expressive activities such as limits on amplified sound and prohibitions on sticks and open flames apply both to members of the UT community and members of the general public Are there rules to prevent people from disrupting classes exams and the other daily business of the campus Yes In keeping with the U S Constitution the law allows the university to regulate the time place and manner of free speech activities so long as these rules are content neutral and applied regardless of the speaker s viewpoint All previous university time place and manner rules remain in place and will be extended to members of the general public who come to campus What are some of the time place and manner rules in place on campus A full list of rules can be found in Chapters 10 and 13 of the University s Institutional Rules Some of the specific measures Reservations are required to use amplified sound at any time During weekday business hours amplified sound can only be used at designated times and in designated areas with a reservation link to map Permitted expressive activity does not allow the use of sticks or batons including metal plastic or wood poles affixed to signs Open flames are prohibited on campus Community members and visitors cannot obscure their faces with masks Community members and visitors must allow a 10 foot clearance around points of entry and the perimeter of all university buildings The general public is not permitted to hang signs or banners on campus buildings landscaping hardscape or trees Campus community members may apply through the dean of students for use of a temporary banner space in the university s limited public forum Commercial solicitation is prohibited Can members of the public reserve a space for their expressive activities on campus Yes Members of the public may reserve a space in the common outdoor area or an amplified sound area by making a request to reservepublicforum austin utexas edu Is amplified sound restricted on campus under the new rules Yes During weekdays amplified sound is only permitted in designated areas by people or groups that have submitted requests and received permission These spaces are part of the common outdoor area that members of the public may use Six of these eight areas have an occupancy capacity of 100 persons or more This map contains the locations weekday time restrictions and occupancy limits for each area After 5 p m or on weekends amplified sound is permitted in all common outdoor areas by people or groups that have submitted requests and received permission The Dean of Students administers the reservations for these areas UT community members will continue to use the same process available in the past to reserve these spaces through a form provided by the Dean of Students Members of the public may reserve space by emailing reservepublicforum austin utexas edu Can members of the general public come into academic buildings for expressive activities No The new law applies only to common outdoor areas The university buildings are for campus community members and invited guests use The outside walls and surfaces of university buildings or structures walls or surfaces connected to a university building and spaces dedicated to temporary outdoor banners or exhibits are not part of the common outdoor area so are not available to the public for their use If I think there is a violation of SB 18 how can I report it Students wishing to make a grievance regarding a violation of the new law may report it via the university compliance and ethics hotline by emailing hotline compliance utexas edu If anyone feels physically threatened in any situation the first action should always be to call 911 and engage UTPD What disciplinary processes are in place for those who interfere with another person s right of free expression UT Austin does not tolerate behavior that unlawfully interferes with another person s exercise of free speech Students student organizations and faculty members who interfere with another person s free speech activities are subject to discipline as set out in 13 1202 Members of the public who impede another s free speech may be subject to criminal trespass charges arrest or other lawful measures Can anyone use the campus for commercial activities such as filming advertisements or distributing products No Commercial activities are expressly prohibited Who can post banners and exhibits on campus Student faculty members and staff organizations and academic and administrative units are permitted to hang banners and display exhibits on campus through a reservation process This expressive activity is considered part of the university s educational mission and reserved solely for university community members The spaces set aside for temporary banner space and temporary exhibit space are part of the university s limited public forum that is not available to the general

provide the University personal information when they apply for an EID from the University or seek financial aid or visit certain parts of the University Web or make use of University Health Services or similar student or employee services In addition to the application process or an individual requesting University services the University may also acquire personal information when a person seeks to interact or do business with the University or to participate in research or other activities offered by the University As discussed elsewhere in this policy some University Web as well as third party s webpages use cookies to collect information about the web user University Web servers Web Server may also collect information about people by generating temporary logs that may contain the following information Internet address IP address of computer being used Web pages requested Referring Web page Browser used Date and Time UIN unique person identifier for EID based services only The data collected on the University Web are used in aggregate by IT custodians to tune the University Web site for its efficiency and are not ordinarily associated with specific individuals Raw data from the Web Server logs are only shared with the custodian of each University Web site Summary reports produced from the logs help University Web publishers determine what University Web browsers and pages are most popular For example if the aggregate reports show that a particular University Web page is very popular or is used more by freshmen than by seniors publishers might use this information to customize the content of that page and make it easier to find Individual data gathered through a specific process such as the submission of an application to attend the University related submissions and subsequent interaction with admissions staff will only be used for its intended purpose such as the consideration of an applicant for admission or an employment decision or for certain archiving research or statistical purposes described below Personal information may also come from third parties that are authorized to provide personal information to the University The University may use personal data it collects for a specific purpose and further process that personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes research purposes Processing for research purposes will be subject to appropriate safeguards including the use of data minimization and pseudonyms when possible The University will anonymize the personal data it uses for research purposes whenever the University can fulfill the purpose without the need of identification of the personal data subject The University is not required to provide notice to data subjects when it further processes personal data for research purposes Further processing of personal data for research purposes is only permitted when the purpose of the processing is to support the University Further processing of personal data by researchers for their own research purposes is not permitted unless the researcher follows the University s processes for human subject research if applicable and the researcher provides any required notice to the data subjects 7 Cookies Cookies are small pieces of data stored by the University Web browser Cookies are often used to remember information about preferences and pages a person has visited For example when a person visits some sites on the University Web they might see a Welcome Back message The first time the person visited the site a cookie was probably set on their computer when they return the cookie is read again A person can configure their web browser to refuse to accept cookies to disable cookies and to remove cookies from their hard drive as needed University Web servers use cookies in the centralized authentication system called UT EID The University uses these cookies so that users will not have to repeatedly enter user names and passwords when they go to different parts of the University Web Normally a person is required to enter a UT EID when they request data about themselves or to ensure that they are a member of the University community For example students who want to check their admission status or staff members who complete time sheets must enter their UT EID so the system knows who is requesting the data This login process uses Secure Sockets Layer SSL so the user name and password are encrypted between the Web browser and our Web server Some Web Servers may also use cookies to retain user preference information It is against university policy to share this information with external third parties 8 Third party content on UT Websites Some pages within the utexas edu domain may contain content that is served from external third parties For example a utexas edu web site might include a graphic logo or a script from a third party Specifically the following code within a utexas edu page would represent an example of third party content img src 3Ca 20href 3D http www other org com logo gif http www other org com logo gif alt Sample In this example logo gif would be third party content served from a web server outside the utexas edu domain www other org com in this case Third party content in utexas edu is not limited to graphics but this is the most frequent use The University does not transmit any information to these third parties as part of such requests However when a person visits utexas edu pages that contain third party content information such as their IP address date browser and requested page is transmitted from your computer to that third party 9 Grounds for Processing Personal Data and How It is Used by the

Featured Monday 07 December 2020 Cason Hunwick College Campus Photograph by Matt Wright Steele Shilpa Rajagopal is a biology and marketing senior who wants to work in health care but you won t find her glued to a textbook Instead she s stocking shelves at the Micah 6 food pantry helping underserved communities access donated goods Or she s volunteering at the C D Doyle clinic referring patients to local care regardless of their residency or insurance status Rajagopal also serves on the college Diversity Equity and Inclusion community and leads the Natural Sciences Council a student run organization that serves the science student body and helps lobby for institutional changes You and the NSC helped lobby for a new name for the Robert Lee Moore building which this summer got renamed the Physics Math and Astronomy PMA building How do you think about that victory I think in some ways it s a beginning I think renaming has been a really powerful example of how communities across campus including People for PMA PMA Board for Student Advocacy NSC and UT Senate can come together and successfully advocate for change It s a symbolic change and an important one But there are broader issues in the sciences whether it s recruitment of students of color hiring processes admissions policies There are some next steps we can take to be more inclusive Editor s note Dean Goldbart announced last month a series of next steps the college is taking In addition to volunteering with a food pantry and a low income health clinic you also worked as a hospice care volunteer What was that experience like I remember visiting a woman who was non verbal and I played Frank Sinatra music to her Even though she couldn t speak you could see in her eyes by the way she moved she was captured Connecting with her meant the world because end of life patients at hospice centers can sometimes face neglect and loneliness Why do you think volunteering will help you become a better doctor or public health professional I think medicine is defined by its humanity It s fundamentally rooted in empathy and being able to form relationships Whether that happens through volunteering exploring the humanities or going out and experiencing things It informs your perspective so much more than staying in your own bubble Why do you get involved in so many different ways There s this Audre Lorde quote that speaks to what I do that says There s no such thing as a single issue struggle because we don t lead single issue lives That shaped my perspective and helped me understand how so many challenges overlap whether that s poverty food insecurity or access to health care Tags Physics health medicine Undergraduates Looking Forward The Hearts and Minds Behind AI About the author

Research with Great Societal Benefit Featured Tuesday 01 December 2020 Christine S Sinatra Molecular Biosciences Jason McLellan left and Daniel Wrapp have been awarded the Golden Goose Award Credit Vivian Abagiu The world s largest multidisciplinary scientific society has announced that Jason McLellan a University of Texas at Austin associate professor in the Department of Molecular Biosciences and Daniel Wrapp a graduate student fellow were among seven winners of this year s Golden Goose Award Supported by members of Congress from both parties and a coalition of businesses universities and scientific societies since 2012 the prize this year went to scientists whose federally funded research has had a significant impact for the response and treatment of COVID 19 The American Association for the Advancement of Science AAAS cited winners contributions that led to the development of promising vaccines antibody treatments and other efforts to thwart COVID 19 McLellan and Wrapp received recognition for work with scientists in Belgium and elsewhere to engineer an antibody produced by llamas for use in fighting the current coronavirus The pair also collaborated with researchers at the National Institutes of Health s Vaccine Research Center to develop a stabilized spike protein now used as an antigen in many leading vaccines to fight the current coronavirus SARS CoV 2 These were two of three projects that received 2020 Golden Goose Award recognition It is the first time a scientist has received recognition in more than one Golden Goose Award These dedicated academic researchers and their colleagues provided the vital foundation that was necessary for many of the vaccines and treatments that hold great promise for humanity today said Paul Goldbart dean of UT Austin s College of Natural Sciences It is fortunate for us all that not only was the seed corn of basic research planted long ago here at The University of Texas at Austin and beyond but that these scientists have worked tirelessly all year to ensure the arrival of vaccines treatments and knowledge to curb the coronavirus crisis In this year s award announcement organizers noted that it is too soon to know the full impact of the winners groundbreaking research but recipients demonstrate how scientific advances resulting from foundational research can help respond to national and global challenges Each year the award honors scientists whose research may have sounded odd or obscure when first conducted but has since resulted in significant benefits to society The coalition that created the Golden Goose Award in 2012 did so as a counterpoint to criticisms of basic research as wasteful federal spending a notion once embodied by the so called Golden Fleece Awards given by the late Sen William Proxmire Rep Jim Cooper D Tenn who initiated the idea for the Golden Goose Award indicated that COVID 19 provides an opportunity to appreciate science and the need to ensure more scientists can do more great work to help lead our nation our world and our universe forward Two fellow winners of Golden Goose Award recognition this year Kizzmekia Corbett and Barney Graham both at the National Institutes of Health NIH s Vaccine Research Center collaborated with McLellan and Wrapp on both the stabilized spike protein work and the llama antibody research Other winners this year were Emmie de Wit and Vincent Munster at the NIH and James Crowe at the Vanderbilt Vaccine Center Honorees will be recognized at a virtual awards ceremony today at 3 p m CT McLellan who holds the Robert A Welch Chair in Chemistry and his team which includes Wrapp received federal support for the two research projects via the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy s Argonne National Laboratory State and philanthropic funding also support the team s research McLellan is a member of the LaMontagne Center for Infectious Disease and he and

Rebecca A Johnson Astronomy The Hobby Eberly Telescope at dusk The flags of the four partner institutions fly with the U S flag outside the open dome Credit Ethan Tweedie Photography Three years into its quest to reveal the nature of dark energy the Hobby Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment HETDEX is on track to complete the largest map of the cosmos ever The team will create a three dimensional map of 2 5 million galaxies that will help astronomers understand how and why the expansion of the universe is speeding up over time This image of the Pinwheel Galaxy shows the power of the VIRUS instrument created for the HETDEX survey VIRUS has recorded the cosmic fingerprint for every point on this image with one of its 32 000 optical fibers This provides information on the speed direction and chemical makeup of the material that produced the light The breakout boxes show four examples Clockwise from top left a white dwarf star in our galaxy an active galaxy 11 billion light years away a star forming region in the Pinwheel Galaxy 20 million light years away and a star forming galaxy 3 billion light years away Credit G Zeimann HETDEX Collaboration HETDEX represents the coming together of many astronomers and institutions to conduct the first major study of how dark energy changes over time said Taft Armandroff Director of The University of Texas at Austin s McDonald Observatory The survey began in January 2017 on the 10 meter Hobby Eberly Telescope HET at McDonald Observatory Today the survey is 38 complete Data reduction and analysis are continuing HETDEX has arrived said astronomer Karl Gebhardt We re over a third of the way through our program now and we have this fantastic dataset that we re going to use to measure the dark energy evolution The survey works by aiming the telescope at two regions of the sky near the Big Dipper and Orion For each pointing the telescope records around 32 000 spectra capturing the cosmic fingerprint of the light from every object within the telescope s field of view It s actually a little mind blowing how much information is captured in this said team member Gary Hill These spectra are recorded via 32 000 optical fibers that feed into more than 100 instruments working together as one This assembly is called VIRUS the Visible Integral field Replicable Unit Spectrograph It s a massive machine made up of dozens of copies of an instrument working together for efficiency VIRUS was designed and built especially for HETDEX This makes VIRUS one of the most advanced astronomical instruments in the world Building it was quite a task to orchestrate Hill said noting that the project has taken a decade to reach fruition It s the largest on many measures he said noting that it has the most optical fibers as well as having as much detector area as the largest astronomical cameras It s also an extremely large instrument taking up much of the room inside the telescope dome HETDEX is a blind survey meaning that rather than pointing at specific targets it records everything over a specific patch of sky Then scientists go back through to the data later to sift out specific objects they want to study Team member Phillip MacQueen has worked on the technical challenges of delivering VIRUS to the HETDEX specifications He reminds us that map making in astronomy started with the first people who looked at the sky VIRUS is an astronomical cartographer s delight MacQueen said It does much more than map where objects are in two dimensions on the sky HETDEX is using VIRUS to map where objects lie in a truly enormous volume of the universe both within our galaxy and far beyond it To make the map needed for the dark energy project they are combing through a billion spectra looking for examples of a specific type of galaxy These galaxies range in distances from 10 billion to 11 7 billion light years away so they represent an epoch when the universe was only a few billion years old Their spectra carry information about how fast the galaxies are moving away from us as a result of the expansion of the universe That will allow astronomers to determine how the rate at which the universe expands has changed over the eons which is key to determining the nature of dark energy The HETDEX team expects to complete their observations by December 2023 In total the completed survey will include one billion spectra the largest ever spectral survey by far Gebhardt said These data are processed and stored at UT Austin s Texas Advanced Computing Center TACC one of the top supercomputing centers in the world Erin Mentuch Cooper is the project s data manager We re very fortunate to have access to TACC she said explaining that over the summer a TACC supercomputer processed all of the HETDEX data now in hand in two weeks It would have taken a single computer 10 years she said Meanwhile many astronomers are using the data already collected to attack a number of other astronomical mysteries Several are on the verge of publishing their research One such is UT professor Keith Hawkins He has made use of the survey s spectra of about 100 000 stars in our own Milky Way galaxy Though these stars were not the main quarry for HETDEX they were captured by the blind survey As my grandfather used to say One man s trash is another man s treasure he said Hawkins is using these spectra to study the stars contents sizes temperatures and motions to trace how the different parts of our galaxy came together His research paper on this work will be published soon Other astronomers are preparing to publish research on white dwarfs and nearby galaxies for which they used HETDEX data HETDEX is a large international collaboration The project is led by The University of Texas at Austin McDonald Observatory and Department of Astronomy with participation from Penn State University Ludwig Maximilians University Munich the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics the Institute for Astrophysics Gottingen the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam Texas A M University The University of Oxford the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics The University of Tokyo and the Missouri University of Science and Technology In addition to Institutional support HETDEX is funded by the National Science Foundation grant AST 0926815 the State of Texas the US Air Force AFRL FA9451 04 2

Featured Monday 30 November 2020 Esther R Robards Forbes Human Ecology For older adults living alone during the pandemic in person visits bring benefits to emotional wellbeing distinct from what they experience from phone calls or electronic communication University of Texas at Austin researchers have found In a study out this month in the Journals of Gerontology Series B Social Science researchers surveyed 226 people age 69 and up in May and June 2020 to determine the impacts of the COVID 19 pandemic on the lives of older adults Of those surveyed 81 lived alone and 145 lived with spouses family or other people Nearly all the older adults were taking safety precautions sheltering in place and avoiding contact with people outside their home The study found that older adults who live alone are more affected by social contact during the pandemic Individuals who live alone experienced more positive emotions when they saw someone in person than people who had no contact These older adults were also appropriately aware that in person contact could put them at high risk of a life threatening disease said Karen Fingerman an author of the study and co director of the Texas Aging and Longevity Center at The University of Texas at Austin She recommended that those who seek to support emotional well being in older adults living alone with in person contact do so while following safety guidelines for COVID 19 such as limited contact with other individuals who are also sequestering keeping that contact at a distance of at least 6 feet visiting outside and mask wearing For those living alone phone calls actually were often linked to negative emotions especially loneliness This is not to discourage people from reaching out to older loved ones by phone Fingerman said But it is important to be aware of potential impacts and plan around that Fingerman suggested older adults living alone might schedule phone calls on days they may also see a friend in person from a distance and while wearing a face mask The study found that friends play an important role for older adults living alone Those living alone had more contact with friends both in person and by phone than with family members during the pandemic Most of the participants reported that contact with family members was the same or more frequent during the pandemic Those who live alone reported more frequent contact with friends Ye To Ng Shiyang Zhang and Katherine Britt of The University of Texas at Austin Gianna Colera of Texas State University Kira S Birditt of the University of Michigan and Susan T Charles of the University of California at Irvine also contributed to the research The research was funded by grants from the National Institute on Aging and a grant from the

Inference Jingjing Liu homepage MIT We live in a multimodal world watching a cloud unfolding listening to a bird chirping smelling a rose tasting a drop of dew touching a finch feather To perceive the physical world a computer system needs to process these multimodal signals and fuse diverse knowledge across modalities to reach a holistic understanding of its complex surroundings Take visual and lingual signals as an example Multimodal embedding has been the bedrock for almost all Vision Language V L tasks where multimodality inputs are simultaneously processed for joint visual and textual understanding In this talk I will introduce UNITER UNiversal Image TExt Representation and HERO Hierarchical EncodeR for videO language representation learning and explain their key ingredients of pre

Friday October 23 2020 11 00AM ZoomOne one signup Factored Value Functions for Cooperative Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning Shimon Whiteson homepage Oxford Cooperative multi agent reinforcement learning MARL considers how teams of agents can coordinate their behaviour to efficiently achieve common goals A key challenge therein is how to learn cooperative policies in a centralised fashion that nonetheless can be executed in a decentralised fashion In this talk I will discuss QMIX a simple but powerful cooperative MARL algorithm that relies on factored value functions both to make learning efficient and to ensure decentralisability Extensive results on the StarCraft Multi Agent Challenge SMAC a benchmark we have developed confirm that QMIX outperforms alternative approaches though further analysis shows that this is not always for the reasons we expected About the speaker Bio Shimon Whiteson is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Oxford and the Head of Research at Waymo UK His research focuses on deep reinforcement learning and learning from demonstration with applications in robotics and video games He completed his doctorate at the University of Texas at Austin in 2007 He spent eight years as an Assistant and then an Associate Professor at the University of Amsterdam before joining Oxford as an Associate Professor in 2015 He was awarded a Starting Grant from the European Research Council in 2014 a Google Faculty Research Award in 2017 and a JPMorgan Faculty Award in 2019 Watch Online Wednesday October 28 2020 11 00AM ZoomOne one signup Improving Compositional Generalization with Latent Tree Structures Jonathan Berant homepage Tel Aviv University A recent focus in machine learning and natural language processing is on models that generalize beyond their training distribution One natural form of such generalization which humans excel in is compositional generalization the ability to generalize at test time to new unobserved compositions of atomic components that were observed at training time Recent work has shown that current models struggle to generalize in such scenarios In this talk I will present recent work which demonstrates how an inductive bias towards tree structures substantially improves compositional generalization in two question answering setups First we present a model that given a compositional question and an image constructs a tree over the input question and answers the question from the root representation Trees are not given at training time and are fully induced from the answer supervision only We show that our approach improves compositional generalization on the CLOSURE dataset from 72 2 96 1 accuracy while obtaining comparable performance to models such as FILM and MAC on human authored questions Second we present a span based semantic parser which induces a tree over the input to compute an output logical form handling a certain sub class of non projective trees We evaluate this on several compositional splits of existing datasets improving performance on Geo880 e g from 54 0 82 2 Overall we view these results as strong evidence that an inductive bias towards tree structures dramatically improves compositional generalization compared to existing approaches About the speaker Bio My field of research is Natural Language Processing I work on Natural Language Understanding problems such as Semantic Parsing Question Answering Paraphrasing Reading Comprehension and Textual Entailment I am mostly excited about learning from weak supervision that is easy to obtain and grounded in the world and in tasks that require multi step inference or handling of language compositionality I am an associate professor at the Blavatnik School of Computer Science and a Research Scientist and The Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence Friday November 6 2020 11 00AM ZoomOne one signup Title Embeddings of spoken words across tasks and languages Karen Livescu homepage TTIC Word embeddings have become a ubiquitous tool in natural language processing These embeddings represent the meanings of written words On the other hand for spoken language it may be more important to represent how a written word sounds rather than or in addition to what it means For some applications it can also be helpful to represent variable length acoustic signals corresponding to words or other linguistic units as fixed dimensional vectors or acoustic word embeddings Closely related are acoustically grounded embeddings of written words that is embeddings that represent the way a written word sounds by training on paired acoustic and textual data Such embeddings can be useful for speeding up or improving performance on a number of speech tasks This talk will present work on both acoustic word embeddings and acoustically grounded written word embeddings including their applications for improved speech recognition and search in English and across languages About the speaker Bio Karen Livescu is an Associate Professor at TTI Chicago She completed her PhD in electrical engineering and computer science at MIT Her main research interests are in speech and language processing as well as related problems in machine learning Her recent work includes unsupervised and multi view representation learning acoustic word embeddings visually grounded speech modeling and automatic sign language recognition Her recent professional activities include serving as a program chair of ICLR 2019 and a technical chair of ASRU 2015 2017 2019 Friday November 13 2020 11 00AM ZoomOne one signup Knowledge Rich Neural Text Comprehension and Reasoning Hanna Hajishirzi homepage University of Washington Enormous amounts of ever changing knowledge are available online in diverse textual styles e g news vs science text and diverse formats knowledge bases vs web pages vs textual documents This talk presents the question of textual comprehension and reasoning given this diversity how can AI help applications comprehend and combine evidence from variable evolving sources of textual knowledge to make complex inferences and draw logical conclusions I present question answering and fact checking algorithms that offer rich natural language comprehension using multi hop and interpretable reasoning Recent advances in deep learning algorithms large scale datasets and industry scale computational resources are spurring progress in many Natural Language Processing NLP tasks including question answering Nevertheless current models lack the ability to answer complex questions that require them to reason intelligently across diverse sources and explain their decisions Further these models cannot scale up when task annotated training data are scarce and computational resources are limited With a focus on textual comprehension and reasoning this talk will present some of the most recent efforts in my lab to integrate capabilities of symbolic AI approaches into current deep learning algorithms I will present interpretable algorithms that understand and reason about textual knowledge across varied formats and styles generalize to emerging domains with scarce training data are robust and operate efficiently under resource limitations are scalable About the speaker Bio Hanna Hajishirzi is an Assistant Professor in the Paul G Allen School of Computer Science Engineering at the University of Washington and a Research Fellow at the Allen Institute for AI Her research spans different areas in NLP and AI focusing on developing machine learning algorithms that represent comprehend and reason about diverse forms of data at large scale Applications for these algorithms include question answering reading comprehension representation learning knowledge extraction and conversational dialogue Honors include the Sloan Fellowship Allen Distinguished Investigator Award Intel rising star award multiple best paper and honorable mention awards and several industry research faculty awards Hanna received her PhD from University of Illinois and spent a year as a postdoc at Disney Research and CMU Friday December 4 2020 11 00AM ZoomOne one signup Leveraging Language in Learning Robot Manipulation Skills Jeanette Bohg homepage Stanford Humans have gradually developed language mastered complex motor skills created and utilized sophisticated tools The act of conceptualization is fundamental to these abilities because it allows humans to mentally represent summarize and abstract diverse knowledge and skills By means of abstraction concepts that we learn from a limited number of examples can be extended to a potentially infinite set of new and unanticipated situations My long term goal is to endow robots with this generalization ability In this talk I will present work that gives robots the ability to acquire a variety of manipulation concepts that act as mental representations of verbs in a natural language instruction We propose to use learning from human demonstrations of manipulation actions as recorded in large scale video data sets that are annotated with natural language instructions Specifically we propose to use a video classifier that scores how well the robot imitates the human actions This approach alleviates the need for hand designing rewards and for time consuming processes such as teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching In extensive simulation experiments we show that the policy learned in the proposed way can perform a large percentage of the 78 different manipulation tasks on which it was trained The tasks are of greater variety and complexity than previously considered collections of robotic manipulation tasks We show that the policy generalizes over variations of the environment We also show examples of successful generalization over novel but similar instructions About the speaker Bio Jeannette Bohg is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Stanford

Together Industry and Academic Research Efforts Submitted by Julianne Hodges on Mon 12 04 2017 12 00am Starting this fall UT and industry will work together to further innovation in the field of computer systems research through a program called the Systems Research Consortium launched by the UT Department of Computer Science Led by UTCS professors Simon Peter Emmett Witchel Vijay Chidambaram and Chris Rossbach the consortium will bring companies that rely on computer science together with researchers on campus to help guide research at UT and introduce problems that need to be solved in the industry So far Microsoft Google and telecommunications company Huawei have joined the consortium as industry sponsors These types of partnerships not only allow academic researchers to work on interesting problems but they give opportunities for industry to benefit from cutting edge research and student talent The systems research consortium is a win win says Peter It s a win for industry because they will stay abreast of the latest research that we are doing and at the same time we are staying up to date with the real problems that industry sees which is important for us because it helps us steer our research a little bit In software engineering systems refers to the organization of operating systems which support all the other software applications on a computer Systems research focuses on developing ways to make software run more efficiently through the organization of these operating systems This research can be used to improve applications such as data centers and communication networks Systems is extremely relevant to industry from a very practical standpoint says Rossbach No matter where you re operating in industry if you re somebody who builds web applications or runs a service you care about a whole bunch of things underneath that which are the subject of systems research Research in that area will make it easier for you to build things that function in a reliable way and are efficient Chidambaram says many common online services such as Google and Facebook have extremely sophisticated systems and research is vital to improve these services Our world is exploding with information Chidambaram says Handling this much data and making sense of it requires robust systems infrastructure with high performance According to Peter systems research is highly practical and has immediate relevance in the real world The consortium will allow researchers to hear about problems and trends in industry and anticipate what systems will look like in the future which is something that most companies do not have the luxury to do A major area of systems research is improving the efficiency of data going into and out of servers According to Peter this issue is of interest to search engine companies such as Google because if a search result takes more than a few tens of milliseconds to appear the user will get bored and use another search engine However assembling these search results is very complex and involves contacting hundreds or thousands of servers in a data center Each of these lookups that has to happen will contribute to the overall latency to serve you this page explains Peter This means for each of these hundreds of backend servers the times that they have to be able to react in has to be even smaller on the order of microseconds We re working on trying to cut down on these service times for these hundreds of backend servers so that the web page can be presented to you the end user on the order of milliseconds The cornerstone of the consortium is an annual workshop series hosted at UT the Texas Systems Research Symposium starting in the spring of 2018 The symposium will be an opportunity for industry partners to discuss technical challenges they encounter and for faculty and graduate students to present their research It s very important to us because it helps us to stay on top of the problems and trends that industry sees Peter says It s also very important to industry because that s the main means of output that we have to tell industry what the latest research is and to have a discussion with them In the consortium industry partners can send engineers to the university to work together with researchers on site The program will also include opportunities for representatives of industry participants to give seminar lectures or guest lectures on campus and recruit students While the consortium will mostly be for researchers and graduate students undergraduate students will also benefit from interactions with companies through classroom interactions and events We invite an engineer to come and give a lecture in a classroom or to just come by and talk a little bit about what they re doing which can help the students decide if this is an interesting company they d like to work for says Peter It also gives them hands on experience on how the systems concepts that we re teaching here are being used in practice in industry One factor in the creation of the systems consortium was that UT Computer Science added three new systems faculty Peter Rossbach and Chidambaram in 2016 Peter whose PhD advisor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich had previously worked in industry and started a similar program there says he realized the importance of collaboration with industry and knew he wanted to do something similar at UT Our students do internships at these companies they take the technology that we develop in the lab they bring them into the company they can potentially bring back interesting problems and new challenges Witchel says That s where the magic happens in these relationships Add new comment Your name E mail The content of this

Science Professors Teams Up with Intel Submitted by Anonymous on Tue 11 10 2020 12 50pm A visual representation of a graph containing epidemiological data Industry analysts say that more data has been collected in the past two years than in all of human history combined Data about what we buy what we watch where we go and who our friends are is constantly being collected and stored Analyzing all that data and gaining insights from it is the hard part Enter University of Texas at Austin computer science professor Keshav Pingali and assistant professor Chris Rossbach founders of Katana Graph a startup specializing in graph computing The startup launched in the spring and already has raised 4 4 million Intel recently announced a new partnership with the company to support those hoping to translate large unstructured data sets into efficient solutions to problems Katana Graph s graph computing engine will be offered on several of Intel s platforms You may not have heard of graph computing but companies that use graph computing are likely using it now to learn about you Graphs are a way of drawing insights from unstructured data Structured data is what is found in a carefully constructed database where relationships between data are clear Unstructured data do not have clear relationships and that s where graphs come in Imagine an airline route map with lines connecting hub cities with smaller cities There may not be a direct flight from Cincinnati to San Francisco but it s still possible to get there Just as finding the connecting flights allows for arrival at a destination discovering connections between different data points using graphs helps businesses and organizations understand who they serve For example they help Netflix suggest what we should watch next and help Amazon tell us what to buy next Graphs are a way of thinking about data said Pingali CEO of Katana Graph They simplify the job of designing algorithms to process the data and extract insights In the summer of 2019 Pingali the W A Tex Moncrief Jr Chair in Distributed and Grid Computing was visiting his sister in the San Francisco Bay Area following the sale of her startup company After chatting with venture capitalists Pingali pitched the idea for a graph computing company to Rossbach who holds the Computer Sciences Endowed Faculty Fellowship No 6 and has expertise in cloud computing They formed Katana Graph and the startup received its seed funding on March 15 2020 just in time for the global pandemic to hit It hasn t slowed them down much Already Katana Graph s engines are being used in pharmaceutical research to help narrow down which molecular compounds should be tested in the lab epidemiological tracking of COVID 19 computer network security and detection of financial fraud The pandemic makes collaboration a little harder said Rossbach There are definitely times when it would be great to have a whiteboard But by and large we ve made a lot of progress and continue to have a lot of fun and largely be unaffected so I think we re very lucky in that regard Pingali and Rossbach credit some of the success of their company s launch to the support they received from UT Austin The college has been incredibly supportive of this from our chair to the dean Pingali said Everywhere wants to be the next Silicon Valley but putting that sort of desire into action into something that actually makes things happen that s a totally different thing And not many places can do it Katana Graph also received support from the Texas Innovation Center the hub at The University of Texas at Austin for bringing engineering and science discoveries and technologies to the market The Texas Innovation Center is a collaboration between the Cockrell School of Engineering and the College of Natural Sciences which provides resources to help connect companies like Katana Graph with potential customers investors mentors and other needed resources to support translation of university research Through the center IP support is provided by the Office of Technology Commercialization This recent partnership with Intel and an expected new round of funding will fuel an accelerated growth for Katana Graph and adoption of its graph engine said Dr Van Truskett executive director of the Texas Innovation Center Katana Graph is recruiting and employing UT students to work at their company Their success is an example of impact that university research and their resulting startups can have on the economy Cross posted from the College of Natural Sciences website

Collaborate in Robotics Consortium Submitted by Julianne Hodges on Thu 12 07 2017 8 00am UT recently launched the Robotics Consortium a group that brings together researchers from industry and across campus to collaborate on robotics research Peter Stone UTCS professor and the director of the Robotics Consortium said robotics researchers campus wide saw an opportunity to create an organized structure that partnered with leading companies in the robotics industry in order to enhance robotics research and better serve industry needs Additionally the core robotics faculty want to enhance the graduate student experience by exposing them to research of other groups on campus and have direct interaction with industry representatives Bringing together both hardware and software robotics research spans multiple departments on the Forty Acres and includes faculty from computer science mechanical engineering electrical computer engineering and aerospace engineering For example mechanical engineering includes building motors and gears while computer science and electrical engineering deals with machine learning algorithms and human robot interactions Stone said In the past the different robotics labs have held seminars to showcase their collaborative work This semester the robotics faculty have also hosted open houses and lab tours every other week These events let researchers show off their work and bring together the grad students to discuss their research UT recently launched a robotics graduate portfolio program as part of the robotics consortium The portfolio program is one way to communicate that we re really serious about robotics here enough so that we can provide a certification for our graduate students that they specialize in robotics said Scott Niekum UTCS professor and core robotics faculty member of the consortium It s a really good way to signal expertise to industry as well Additionally the graduate portfolio program provides a platform for companies to easily recruit robotics focused students Robotics has been increasingly used for many purposes such as manufacturing jobs where humans are less efficient than robots according to aerospace engineering professor and core robotics faculty Ufuk Topcu The reach of autonomy and robotics into industry is endless and industry pays attention to the things we do Topcu said They want to see what is out there at the forefront of robotics so they can know what to adopt As part of the robotics consortium companies who partner with the program can recruit students working on robotics give talks at the university and send a researcher to work on campus with UT faculty The founding consortium partners are Sandia National Laboratories a nuclear science research institution Arm an international semiconductor and software design company Omnicell a healthcare software company and Orbotech an international company that manufactures electronics Robots are used in a variety of industry applications from working in hazardous environments such as in the nuclear industry to service robots that assist in the home Industry and academia often approach research such as that in the field of robotics in different ways For example companies often work on short term problems while academic researchers focus on long term goals A lot of industry is recognizing that there s potential value in having robust and highly capable robots and robotics but they don t know how to do it all themselves Stone said Some of it they can do and some of it they need to be thinking ahead and they need long term research to help guide the way We also from the research community need guidance from industry as to what are the current unsolved problems and what are the interesting directions to go in the future For example some car companies such as Toyota and Tesla are actively researching and developing autonomous vehicles While these companies are working on improving the functionality of these cars academic researchers can start thinking about the safety of these vehicles how much we can trust them to drive on the streets and what kinds of regulations they may be subject to Topcu explained In this sense within the same problem domain industry and academia can serve to complementing challenges and once both of them make progress we will have a collective solution he said The Robotics Consortium officially launched in the fall semester of 2017 and consists of the core robotics faculty who include Peter Stone Ashish Desphande Scott Niekum Mitch Pryor

Continuity and working from home You are hereHome Leaving Their Mark Submitted by Anonymous on Wed 11 11 2020 2 52pm Photo credit Am rica Quistiano Two UT undergraduate leaders talk about the Department of Computer Science s new endowment and what it means for future students This time this summer in the context of social change and everything things just finally fell into place said Audra Collins a computer science senior at The University of Texas at Austin Collins is president of the Association of Black Computer Scientists ABCS which seeks to create paths to educational and professional success for Black and other underrepresented students in this major Amid the pandemic earlier this year she met with fellow senior and close friend Am rica Quistiano She is president of the Hispanic Association of Computer Scientists HACS which has similar aims for Hispanic and Latinx students Together these two leaders drafted plans to bring about social change for students at the departmental level Black and Hispanic Latinx students have been historically underrepresented in STEM fields and today computer science is no different As the leaders of their respective organizations Collins and Quistiano saw firsthand how underserved and underrepresented students were personally affected Many of their members were the first in their families to pursue a technical degree or any degree at all and they were struggling in their high school to college transitions Meanwhile other members had to work multiple jobs on top of full time enrollment to support themselves financially Collins and Quistiano saw these challenges and wanted to help and support these students It was really two sides coming together Quistiano said We ve been trying to establish funding or scholarships of sorts since forever but for one reason or another it just never worked out While Collins and Quistiano were working on their plans UT s Department of Computer Science was actually at work behind the scenes establishing similar initiatives These initiatives were in line with those proposed by longtime department staff members Amy Bush and Kay Nettle who wanted to help start a scholarship to aid more of those students who had the ability but not the means to study computer science at UT With the department matching Bush and Nettle s funds the mutual goals of the students staff and department came together to create the Texas Computer Science Endowment for Change We have been part of the computer science department as students and employees for over 50 years combined and we ve seen it change in many ways Helping promote diversity in a department that has meant so much to both of us is a pretty amazing legacy said Bush and Nettle Beginning this year the endowment will support diversity and inclusion efforts and fund opportunities for underserved students with a demonstrated passion for technology Being a first generation student myself growing up there wasn t really anyone for me or many of these students to ask about computer science Quistiano said I was laughably unaware of how the tech industry worked and the academics of it all For example for the longest time I thought there was only like one technology major to give you one technology job Quistiano said that she and Collins hoped to create a network of support and mutual understanding among these students While ABCS and HACS do just that the two leaders saw that it wasn t enough for those who were struggling financially They wanted to do more and saw this project as an opportunity to get the department to better acknowledge these students and understand their perspectives Diversity s not just who you admit but also who has the support to stay and actually successfully complete their degree Collins said Brent Winkelman chief of staff of the department wholeheartedly agrees citing the department s long standing focus on not just recruitment but also long term retention which many institutions may overlook There are occasions when we may successfully recruit a student but then the student gets in and discovers Gosh this environment is just not a home for me Winkelman explained As a department we re committed to doing the work to ensure that no student has that reaction We want this to be a place where everyone can feel comfortable and welcome Winkelman said that there are a number of initiatives in the works directed toward diversity and inclusion and that the department is looking to scale up programs such as First Bytes a camp designed to expose high school women to futures in computer science and Code Longhorn a similar program designed for underrepresented populations throughout Texas These initiatives are great because what starts here changes the world right But how can you change the world if the people creating and building new things are not actually representative of the world if not everyone is included in that discussion Quistiano asked As for the beginnings of the new endowment Collins said they conducted extensive research on their own time into budgeting editing writing and drafting proposals They reached out to computer science professor Alison Norman who is also chair of the department s Diversity and Inclusion Committee for mentorship and guidance Norman was not at all surprised when Collins and Quistiano contacted her Our students are amazing she said They re hardworking and caring and they really want to have a positive effect on the world and are always hungry for information about just how to do that Norman provided advice and proofread their early drafts We wanted to be as best prepared as we could be before any sort of archetypal proposal Collins said Alison helped our efforts immensely and we were very persistent she said laughing After the department learned of Collins and Quistiano s ideas both sides worked together I think that everybody s goals were aligned and then it was just a matter of how to best achieve those goals said Norman of the project Soon enough their persistence and the hard work of the staff and faculty paid off Many many presentations virtual meetings discussions and considerations later the endowment was officially established and it started in fall 2020 Today the endowment is listed on HornRaiser for donations and its scholarships are available to current and incoming undergraduate computer science students who have participated in Code Longhorn or who are current or future members of HACS or ABCS The effort for diversity and inclusion has always been there student org wise Collins said but what I wanted to establish is that once I graduate and leave the computer science department the staff actual department and administration they re now the ones leading the charge Quistiano added This is just the beginning Hopefully the endowment will grow and provide support for generations of future students to come and that s the mark we want to leave And the university is proud to uphold that legacy UT houses a lot of world class students in terms of their talent and abilities and also in their desire to have a positive impact Winkelman said And I think that we have seen that repeatedly from students like Audra and Am rica who have asked the department to think more ambitiously about how we can create change Cross posted from UT News News categories Undergraduate

1977 he left IBM Research to join UTCS as an Assistant Professor was promoted through the ranks and retired in 2018 His most important research contribution to society is the invention of secure sockets and prototype implementation of the first secure sockets layer SNP in 1993 for Internet applications This work was published and presented in the 1994 USENIX Summer Technical Conference Subsequent secure sockets layers SSL and TLS re implemented several years later using key ideas first presented in SNP enabled secure e commerce on WWW and are now widely used to secure email and other Internet applications For this contribution Professor Lam and three students in his research project won the 2004 ACM Software System Award He was elected to National Academy of Engineering in

Content Moderators pdf Social media platforms enable people to better connect with one another online such as by sharing user generated content Unfortunately some shared content is unsafe for public consumption and must be filtered Because AI solutions remain insufficient to fully automate this task an estimated 100 000 human workers are being paid today to perform commercial content moderation CCM These moderators are often exposed to various forms of extreme content which has been shown to lead to lasting psychological and emotional damage In this work we investigate issues surrounding the psychological well being of content moderators and potential remedies to reduce the risk and degree of harm to those who choose to perform these jobs Drawing on lessons from related occupations we review wellness in the workplace and best practices for measuring and increasing wellness and resiliency We discuss social psychological and ethical issues faced by firms as well as issues of access power and data faced by researchers in studying CCM We highlight directions for future work and advocate for collaborative partnerships to address challenges Authors Matthew Lease University of Texas

Product Lines Regular Tech Report 06 13 2020 TR 20 01 Smarch pdf Software Product Lines SPLs often have huge numbers of configurations that are impossible to enumerate This raises the need for uniform sampling which yields samples that are representative of the configuration space and enables accurate estimates of configuration properties by classical statistical methods Prior work on sampling SPLs either achieved uniform sampling or scaled to large configuration spaces but not both limiting their applicability to real world SPLs Smarch is a new uniform sampling algorithm that scales to real world SPLs It maintains a one to one correspondence between integers and configurations converting uniformly sampled integers into uniformly sampled configurations As Smarch only creates configurations that are used as samples it has better scalability than other uniform sampling algorithms Smarch can be optimized with respect to variable selection parallelism and caching to reduce its sampling time We evaluate Smarch on 39 real world SPLs Smarch is able to sample configuration spaces as large as 10 417 which is 10 405 times larger than existing uniform sampling algorithms can handle Optimizations make Smarch sampling at least 12 times faster Authors Jeho Oh The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer SciencePaul Gazzillo University of Central FloridaDon Batory University of Texas at AustinMarijn Heule Carnegie Mellon UniversityMargaret Myers University of Texas at Austin Hardware Accelerator for NewHope Algorithm Honors Theses 08 31 2020 HR 20 18 NewHopeThesis pdf Encryption is an important tool used to protect data and we need to ensure that the algorithms we use to verify that data is protected are secure Some operations are considered hard and many encryption algorithms are built around that assumption However some of these assumptions are broken when a quantum computer is doing the operations Because of this the National Institute of Standards and Technology has started a competition for people to develop encryption algorithms that they believe to be secure from attacks by a quantum computer I analyzed and compared the NIST Competition s Round 2 key exchange algorithms I then selected one of these NewHope to implement in Chisel a hardware design language In this thesis we discuss post quantum cryptography the algorithms that made it to Round 2 of the NIST competition the NewHope algorithm and my implementation of it Authors Saarila Kenkare The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Exploring GPU Timing Side Channels Honors Theses 05 12 2020 HR 20 17 turing thesis pdf Machine learning has become an integral part of modern web applications In order to support this compute intensive workload the hardware ecosystem has blossomed with the introduction of new accelerators such as GPUs FPGAs and TPUs The performance gains these accelerators offer have pushed public cloud providers to integrate heterogeneous hardware accelerators as a cornerstone of their cloud infrastructure Many of the users who leverage accelerators in the cloud handle sensitive customer and third party data Uploading this data to the public cloud involves lengthening the customer s chain of trust to include the cloud provider The architecture and systems communities have made significant inroads into solving this problem for CPU computation by providing Trusted Execution Environments TEEs such as Intel Software Guard Extensions SGX 11 and ARM TrustZone 17 These hardware mechanisms allow a cloud user to compute on private data with the guarantee that a malicious administrator cannot directly access or modify the user s application or sensitive information Recently there have been proposals to extend TEEs to protect computation on accelerators We argue that accelerator TEEs are insufficient as a standalone mechanism to protect sensitive computation in a public cloud setting We develop a novel timing attack which allows a privileged adversary to leak sensitive data from a GPU TEE by observing communication patterns between the GPU and CPU To our knowledge this is the first CPU side timing side channel attack which targets GPU computation Our attack targets a standard image recognition workload and is able to distinguish pairs of image classes with over 78 accuracy by timing the underlying communication We extend our attack to classify batches of images outperforming our single image attack by up to 64 Authors Ariel Szekely The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Prophet Inequalities with Application to Options Pricing Honors Theses 06 19 2020 HR 20 16 thesis pdf Optimal stopping or selecting the optimal time to perform an action is crucial when trading financial securities Prophet inequalities a subproblem in optimal stopping compare the profits of online strategies to the profit of an offline strategy that knows the future and always acts optimally It is natural to consider whether results related to prophet inequalities can be usefully applied in the realm of trading To keep this paper tractable we model price movements of these securities as Brow nian motions with negative drift While stopping rules are trivial for standard financial securities i e stocks and futures under these circumstances it is less trivial to identify an optimal stopping rule for option exercise I show how to compute an optimal stop ping rule for option exercise develop and implement an algorithm following this rule and observe empirical competitive ratios obtained by this strategy Notably this algo rithm can be extended to use arbitrary probability distributions for underlying price movements allowing us to compute expected values even in the case where prices do not follow Brownian motions Authors Nicholas Truong The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Output Oblivious Rate Independent Computation in Real Valued Chemical Reaction Networks Honors Theses 05 28 2020 HR 20 15 kornerup thesis pdf There are many systems in biology that use chemical interactions for decision making Such molecular computing systems which operate via chemical interactions may be useful to engineers in cases where traditional computing systems cannot be used The chemical reaction network CRN model formalizes the notion of chemical interactions allowing us to perform rigorous reasoning about the computational power of chemical interactions In this model we think of a series of chemical reactions as computing a function where the initial concentration of a subset of the species are the inputs and the final concentration of another species is the output In this undergraduate thesis which is intended to be a more intuitive overview of the attached paper we precisely characterise the set of functions computable by output oblivious CRNs CRNs that do not use the output species as a reactant that are rate independent they always produces the correct output independent of the reaction rates as super additive positive continuous and piecewise rational linear Authors Niels Kornerup The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Automating Code and Data Migration After Schema Refactorings Honors Theses 05 22 2020 HR 20 14 thesis pdf This thesis describes two techniques for automating web application developer tasks created when the application s underlying database schema is refactored These schemas are generally refactored to improve performance or maintainability but doing so creates two programmer tasks code migration and data migration My research with the UT Program Analysis UToPiA research group automates both tasks for developers Our first research result for code migration called Migrator appeared at Programming Languages Design and Implementation 2019 Our second research result called Dynamite will appear at the Conference on Very Large Databases 2020 Authors Rushi Shah The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science SASIL A Domain Specific Language for Simulating Declarative Specifications of Scheduling Systems Honors Theses 05 21 2020 HR 20 13 dsl pdf SASIL is a domain specific language to describe and execute the specification of scheduling systems The language interpreter operates on time dependent behaviors and reactive events to simulate the described system Furthermore the interpreter is capable of selecting the appropriate actions needed to automatically schedule necessary components of the system to resolve requests The DSL was tested by implementing an elevator control system which is defined as a series of button requests and the requirements needed to complete each request A multi elevator system described using the language allowed the interpreter to complete requests 1 04 times faster on average than the traditional elevator algorithm Authors Gahwon Lee The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science The Effect of Out of Order Execution on the Cache Hierarchy Honors Theses 05 21 2020 HR 20 12 Turing Thesis pdf Out of order execution is used in almost all modern processors due to its ability to vastly improve performance However out of order execution causes disorder in the cache hierarchy which means memory accesses will appear out of order We look to identify the extent of this disorder along with its effects on prefetcher performance Our study on disorder looks into three main areas First we look at how much disorder changes in the cache hierarchy through each level of the cache Second we look at how varying the reorder buffer size affects disorder Third we look at the effect of this disorder on prefetcher performance by comparing prefetcher performance on cores with varying levels of disorder First our study of the cache hierarchy finds that disorder drops significantly when moving to cache levels further from the processor In particular on average we see a 53 6 increase of instructions that run in program order from L1D to L2C Second from our study of the reorder buffer we find that decreases in reorder buffer size also cause a small decrease in disorder with a 1 increase on average in the L1D for instructions that run in program order Third from our study of prefetchers we find that some prefetchers are sensitive to this disorder and can be negatively impacted by it Variable Data Length Prefetcher was the most sensitive to disorder of the ones we tested with an average decrease in coverage by 11 between in order execution and out of order execution Authors Michael Ott The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Evaluating the Robustness of Natural Language Reward Shaping Models to Spatial Relations Honors Theses 05 19 2020 HR 20 11 Thesis pdf As part of an effort to bridge the gap between using reinforcement learning in simulation and in the real world we probe whether current reward shaping models are able to encode relational data between objects in the environment We construct an augmented dataset for controlling a robotic arm in the Meta World platform to test whether current models are able to discriminate between target objects based on their relations We found that state of the art models are indeed expressive enough to achieve performance comparable to the gold standard so this specific experiment did not uncover any obvious shortcomings Authors Antony Yun The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Physical Simulation of Adhesive Bodies and Their Interactions with Their Environments Honors Theses 05 16 2020 HR 20 10 JakeCrouch AdhesiveBodies pdf This paper outlines modifications that can be made to standard cloth and rigid body algorithms to simulate tape We discuss how to make one sided and two sided tape which we will refer to as adhesive bodies interact with an environment consisting of static bodies rigid bodies and adhesive bodies In this paper we cover criteria for the sticking and detachment of tape to other faces in the environment and we give forces that should act on the faces to create behavior that simulates tape These forces include a force that resists sliding of the adhesive body over other bodies and an adhesive force that resists the peeling of the adhesive body off of another body Authors Clifford Crouch The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Using Supervised Learning Techniques to Predict Television Ratings Honors Theses 05 15 2020 HR 20 09 JacksonHassellThesis pdf How well a given TV show does is scored by a metric called rating which denotes the percentage of households watching live TV at the time that are tuned into that particular show To maximize ratings being able to reliably predict them is necessary For my thesis in collaboration with Austin s public television station KLRU TV a variety of techniques were tested in order to discern the most accurate model for predicting the ratings of a television show airing To accomplish this I created nine regression models each using a different algorithm that has been proven to work across many kinds of problems These were a linear regression model a k nearest neighbors model a SVM model a decision tree model a bagging ensemble model a gradient boosting ensemble model two kinds of fully connected neural networks or MLPs and a recurrent neural network I also created several feature sets which included Nielsen IMDb and engineered features Each model was tested across every combination of feature sets and exhaustively hyperparamatized to find what method produced the best results Most models did similarly well under at least one combination of hyperparameters and feature set with the only exception being the linear regression model which performed poorly across the board The best model was a tie between the k nearest neighbors model and the bagging ensemble model which both received an R2 score of 64 when run on all features Though this is not a perfect score it means the mean average error was just 2 which is small enough to be useful when optimizing program schedules and selling ad space Authors Jackson Hassell The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Crash Consistency Test Generation for the Linux Kernel Honors Theses 05 15 2020 HR 20 08 final pdf Modern file systems try very hard to ensure that they can recover correctly after a crash However the complexity of file systems and the large space of possible bug triggering workloads make this difficult to achieve To find bugs UT has built Crashmonkey an in house test framework that can efficiently simulate various crash scenarios and the Automatic Crash Explorer ACE that can exhaustively generate workloads for Crashmonkey to test The work in this paper builds on both frameworks by creating an adapter to port ACE workloads to xfstests the Linux kernel filesystem test suite In addition I upgrade ACE to programmatically generate crash consistency xfstests tests aimed at code coverage in the Linux kernel I am in the process of patching 9 of these generated tests into xfstests Finally I present a fuzzer that builds on the ACE framework to look for new bugs Authors Arvind Raghavan The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Fingerprinting With Atomic Counters in Upcoming Web Graphics Compute APIs Honors Theses 05 15 2020 HR 20 07 Sabrina Jiang Thesis pdf As modern browsers move towards adding compute features to graphics APIs evidence shows that the attack surface for graphics card fingerprinting increases most notably due to support for atomic operations within the GPU Browser Fingerprinting is a widely used technique to track users accessing a website without the users signing in or authenticating their identity in any way This is a violation of the user s privacy who may not know and may not have consented to being tracked In particular WebGL a browser graphics library has been shown to be a high entropy fingerprinting factor Recently browsers have moved towards adding new graphics compute features One of these endeavors is WebGL 2 0 Compute which includes support for atomic counters In this research we give evidence that adding atomic counters to browser graphics libraries increases the fingerprinting attack surface To do so we set up a dummy website sabrinaj dot me with three sets of tests that leverage the atomic counters Instructions for how to enable WebGL 2 0 Compute features and run the tests are enumerated in section 3 1 The first test involves discovering the order with which the graphics card renders pixels in an image The second and third tests involve using the atomic counter as a homebrewed implicit timer which we show can be constructed by creating high contention for the counter The second test involves timing an arbitrary task and the third test involves probing the graphics card s caching behavior by timing walks of varying sizes through a random buffer The preliminary results from these three tests indicate that the atomic counters in web graphics libraries have potential to become flexible fingerprinting tools Authors Sabrina Jiang The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Applications of Mechanism Design to Cloud Computing Upgrades Honors Theses 05 15 2020 HR 20 06 thesis pdf Abstract pending Authors Will Sherwood The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science An Analysis of Methods of Integration of Hyperparameter Optimization into a Neuroevolutionary Pipeline Honors Theses 05 14 2020 HR 20 05 thesis pdf The field of automated machine learning has developed numerous methods for the problem of neural architecture search NAS One of these is neuroevolution where evolutionary algorithms are used to evolve model architectures When employing this approach the question remains of how best to optimize hyperparameters of the training process such as batch size learning rate and the choice of optimizer To this end we survey various methods of integrating hyperparameter optimization into a neuroevolutionary pipeline to determine their effect on a wide variety of datasets We further analyze meta features of these datasets to see if the efficacy of hyperparameter optimization could be contingent on these meta features Authors Krishna Chittur The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Topic Focused Extractive Summarization Honors Theses 05 12 2020 HR 20 04 Akshay Honors Thesis pdf Extractive single document summarization is the task of condensing a source document into a shorter form while retaining its information content and meaning by identifying important sections of content in the document and generating them verbatim However such systems tend to produce summaries that are often overly generic with little controllability over the output and cannot cater to many individuals unique information needs in a real world setting In this paper we focus on the task of topic focused extractive summarization the task of extractively summarizing a document from some domain with a focus on some particular topic in that domain with the goal of producing tailored summaries as per user controlled specifications We propose a new BERT based neural model to learn this task and build a system which can generate topic focused summaries for unseen documents in some domain as per the user s requirements after being trained on a small number of document summary pairs per domain We run our system on the CNN DM and CourtListener datasets and evaluate it against three baselines LEAD Keyword and BertSum Our experiments show that when evaluated by humans we are able to match the coherence of the LEAD baseline while extracting content and consistently outperform ad hoc keyword based methods and that when evaluated automatically we outperform keyword based methods while providing greater controllability to users Authors Akshay Kumar Gupta The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Using Deep Neural Networks To Predict Chess Player Skill Honors Theses 05 14 2020 HR 20 03 Turing Thesis pdf In this paper we attempt to use deep neural networks to predict the skill of the player for White in a game of chess measured by a chess rating system We use models that rely on two sets of features one based o of the positions on the board at the start of each turn and another that views the evaluation of a player s moves versus the alternatives by a chess engine Authors David Wang Department of Computer Science University of Texas at AustinPhilipp Kr henb hl Department of Computer Science University of Texas at Austin Race Detection for Concurrent Lock Free Objects Honors Theses 05 14 2020 HR 20 02 ThesisPaper pdf Conventional concurrent programming uses mutual exclusion i e locks to ensure that no undesirable race conditions occur It is also easier to find data races in conventional programs using mutual exclusion because there is only one process in the critical section accessing shared data at any one time However current programming techniques are utilizing more lock free programming since there are benefits to not using locks Locks have a number of downsides including Contention A process has to wait until locks are released leading to a slowdown since there are processes not making progress Deadlocks No process is able to make progress since they are all waiting for resources Priority Inversion A low priority process can prevent a high priority process from making progress by holding onto a resource i e a lock the high priority process needs Convoying A process holding a lock gets descheduled leading to other processes being unable to make progress since it does not have a lock Detecting and finding the cause of errors in such programs however is more difficult This is because multiple processes are making changes to shared data simultaneously Only once the program is finished running can one determine if there is an error and reproducing that error is challenging since it is difficult to figure out which interleaving of processes caused the problem Checking the invariants of the shared data while the program is running is a way to find errors in lock free data structures while they are occurring Reproducing errors also becomes easier since by doing this we can pinpoint when the error occurred and isolate it for further debugging Authors Sindhu Reddy The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science A Cross cultural Comparison of Song Lyrics Using NLP Techniques Honors Theses 05 12 2020 HR 20 01 Thesis pdf Song lyrics reflect topical interests and other characteristics of the society in which they are produced and received The content and style of lyrics can therefore shed light on the question of cross cultural similarity or diversity in different societies Using a variety of natural language processing techniques both standard and novel I analyze a corpus of song lyrics from multiple small scale societies and several corpora from larger modern societies both western and non western The results show that the songs from small scale societies differ from their large scale counterparts in topic pronoun usage lexical diversity and sentiment In terms of the same features the lyrics from large scale societies resemble each other despite differences in geographical location language genre and performance context Authors Elizabeth Rego The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Aocl A Pure Java Constraint Language for MDE Regular Tech Report 12 15 2019 TR 19 04 Aocl pdf OCL is a standard language in MDE to express metamodel constraints Since its inception OCL has been criticized for being too complicated over engineered and difficult to learn We have discovered that underneath OCL s design is a streamlined design based on relational algebra Aocl can replace OCL it can be used to write OCLlike constraints and model transformations in Java The theoretical foundation for Aocl is allegories a unification of category theory and relational algebra A simple MDE tool generates an Aocl Java plug in from an input class diagram Authors don batory The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Sciencenajd altoyan The University of Texas at Austin Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Maximum Stable Matching with One Sided Ties of Bounded Length Regular Tech Report 07 21 2019 TR 19 03 maxsmoti bounded pdf We study the problem of finding maximum weakly stable matchings when preference lists are incomplete and contain one sided ties of bounded length We show that if the tie length is at most L then it is possible to achieve an approximation ratio of 1 1 frac 1 L L We also show that the same ratio is an upper bound on the integrality gap which matches the known lower bound In the case where the tie length is at most 2 our result implies an approximation ratio and integrality gap of frac 5 4 which matches the known UG hardness result Authors Chi Kit Lam Department of Computer Science University of Texas at AustinGreg Plaxton Department of Computer Science University of Texas at Austin Uniform Sampling from Kconfig Feature Models Regular Tech Report 03 27 2019 TR 19 02 2018Kconfig pdf Random sampling of configuration spaces is a useful tool for working with software product lines SPLs enabling analyzing and reasoning about spaces too large for exhaustive exploration Being able to create uniform sampling is critical for making statistical inferences about SPLs but it particularly hard for massive real world systems We show how uniform random sampling can be done on systems that use the Kconfig feature modeling language a popular choice among low level and embedded systems Despite its importance prior work considered uniform random sampling infeasible and sampled configurations without confirming that their samples were uniformly distributed Especially existing Kconfig models were not known to be suitable for uniform random sampling although they were used extensively We solve these challenges with algorithmic advances embodied in two tools Kclause to produce compact models and Smarch to perform efficient sampling guaranteed to be uniform Kclause has been extended to model Kconfig semantics with hand tuned simplified formulas that minimizing the number of clauses a critical property for fast sampling Smarch is a new recursive sampling algorithm based on sharpSAT that supports massive configuration spaces with 38 faster sampling times Authors Jeho Oh The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer

Austin Department of Computer ScienceMaggie Myers The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Supporting mixed datatype matrix multiplication within the BLIS framework Regular Tech Report 01 17 2019 TR 19 01 FLAWN89 pdf We approach the problem of implementing mixed datatype support within the general matrix multiplication GEMM operation of the BLIS framework whereby each matrix operand A B and C may be stored as single or double precision real or complex values Another factor of complexity whereby the computation is allowed to take place in a precision different from the storage precisions of either A or B is also included in the discussion We first break the problem into mostly orthogonal dimensions considering the mixing of domains separately from mixing precisions Support for all combinations of matrix operands stored in either the real or complex domain is mapped out by enumerating the cases and describing an implementation approach for each Supporting all combinations of storage and computation precisions is handled by typecasting the matrices at key stages of the computation during packing and or accumulation as needed Several optional optimizations are also documented Performance results gathered on a 56 core Marvell ThunderX2 and a 52 core Intel Xeon Platinum demonstrate that high performance is mostly preserved with modest slowdowns incurred from unavoidable typecast instructions The mixed datatype implementation confirms that combinatoric intractability is avoided with the framework relying on only two assembly microkernels to implement 128 datatype combinations Authors Field G Van Zee The University of Texas at Austin Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences and Department of Computer ScienceDevangi N Parikh The University of Texas at Austin Institute for Computational Engineering and SciencesRobert A van de Geijn The University of Texas at Austin Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences and Department of Computer Science Using Cameras for Handwriting Side Channel Attacks Honors Theses 12 12 2019 HR 19 24 Thesis Neil Patil pdf Camera technology continues to improve year over year with advancements in both hardware capabilities and computer vision algorithms The ever increasing presence of cameras may open the door to a new form of side channel attacks the use of computer vision techniques to infer non digital secrets normally hidden from view In this work we prototype one such attack by building a system that can recover handwritten digits from recorded video of partially occluded pen motion We demonstrate how our prototype which uses common computer vision algorithms and simple classification strategies can predict the written digits with effective accuracy challenging current beliefs around the effectiveness of shielding physical writing in the presence of camera surveillance We conclude that this attack may be representative of a broader class that require acknowledging vision based side channel attacks against physical analog mediums Authors Neil Patil The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Data Augmentation for Deep Transfer Learning Honors Theses 12 09 2019 HR 19 23 Cameron Wolfe Publication 2 pdf Current approaches to deep learning are beginning to rely heavily on transfer learning as an effective method for reducing overfitting improving model performance and quickly learning new tasks Similarly such pre trained models are often used to create embed ding representations for various types of data such as text and images which can then be fed as input into separate downstream models However in cases where such transfer learning models perform poorly i e for data outside of the training distribution one must resort to fine tuning such models or even retraining them completely Currently no form of data augmentation has been pro posed that can be applied directly to embedding inputs to improve downstream model performance In this work we introduce four new types of data augmentation that are generally applicable to embedding inputs thus making them useful in both Natural Lan guage Processing NLP and Computer Vision CV applications For models trained on downstream tasks with such embedding inputs these augmentation methods are shown to improve the AUC score of the models from a score of 0 9582 to 0 9812 and significantly increase the model s ability to identify classes of data that are not seen during training Authors Cameron R Wolfe The University of Texas at

report discusses initial work on the AInix Platform This platform is designed to allow developers to add natural language interfaces to Unix like shell commands This can be used with the aish shell which allows users to intermix natural language with shell commands We create a high level way of specifying semantic parsing grammars and collect a dataset of basic shell commands We experiment with seq2seq models abstract syntax networks ASN and embedded nearest neighbor based models We find highest accuracy is achieved with seq2seq models and ASN s While not as accurate we find that when embedders are pretrained on large scale code related text nearest neighbor models can achieve decent performance Authors David Gros Scaffolding Minimizing Construction Algorithms for Masonry

of masonry buildings can be optimized for reduced scaffolding when we utilize the stability of intermediate structures I show how stability algorithms from previous work can help identify these intermediate structures a novel algorithm for doing so some explanation of my implementation and the results Authors Sue Anne Davis The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science CGAN Fluids Real time Surface Reconstruction of Particle Based Fluids Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks Honors Theses 06 12 2019 HR 19 20 tytrusty thesis pdf In this work I investigate the use of conditional generative adversarial networks CGANs to the application of particle fluid rendering The task of particle based fluid rendering calls for a method mapping a set of discrete infinitesimal points in space to a representation of a realistic fluid surface Current approaches are divided into screen space methods where quality is traded for performance and volume based methods that trade performance for higher fidelity fluid surfaces In this work I describe an approach incorporating methods from real time rendering methods that makes use of CGANs for fast realistic rendering of particle based fluids A neural network is trained to behave as an image filter that maps from a screen space rendering of a fluid to an image that matches the quality of the more expensive volume based methods Authors Ty Trusty The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Multilevel Sampling for Segmentation and Localization Honors Theses 05 31 2019 HR 19 19 TuringThesisFinal pdf Developments in deep learning algorithms continue to push the limits of speed and accuracy in a variety of machine vision problems While more information tends to result in better results these methods are often restricted from operating on large images by their reliance on large amounts of GPU memory While we wait for developments in hardware we look towards methods that compress the input data itself while minimizing loss in output accuracy A recent advance in compressive sensing allows for recovery from exceptionally few samples with the recovery power scaling even further with higher resolution images In this paper we explore the power of this technique in practice and seek to pair it with deep learning solutions to Semantic Segmentation and Object Localization problems We also propose a progressive sampling technique to improve the recovery even further when we have knowledge of regions of interest We find that we can in fact achieve a large factor of compression on our input data without any significant loss in output accuracy Authors Balazs Kustar The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Learning from Optimal Algorithms for Improved Software Cache Replacement Honors Theses 05 29 2019 HR 19 18 Thesis pdf Software caches are ubiquitous in modern systems and are often cru cial for performance Therefore it is important to use a good cache re placement policy However most such caches still use the LRU heuristic which suffers from inflexibility and a poor performance in the worst case Computer architects have recently made significant improvements in the realm of hardware caches so this project applies one of these strategies to software caches There exist optimal algorithms for cache replacement but they require knowledge of future accesses which is impossible in prac tice Since the past has predictive power over the future Hawkeye keeps a history of cache accesses performs the optimal policy over it and learns that policy based on a set of features to approximate the optimal policy on future accesses This project adds and evaluates several optimizations to adapt Hawkeye for software caches It uses a modular approach that can be applied to any of the many types of software cache This adapted policy produces promising results in cache hit rate without sacrificing speed Authors Joanna Bridgwater Exploration of Neural Networks for Stereo Vision Honors Theses 05 25 2019 HR 19 17 VictoriaZhouThesis pdf Accurate camera calibration is a necessary task in order to accurately infer the relationship between the 3D world space and 2D image space This is needed in both autonomous vehicles and home robots We use neural networks to to learn the relationship between the 3D world space and 2D image space and thereby be able to learn and reconstruct 3D space from 2D space We constructed neural networks to transform 3D points to 2D points transform a pair of 2D cartesian points from a stereo camera setup to 3D cartesian points and an autoencoder network to learn an accurate 3D space embedding from 2D point Authors Victoria Zhou The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Using Sentiment Analysis on Reddit Data to Predict Presidential Elections and Polling Honors Theses 05 24 2019 HR 19 16 Draft2 pdf The perceived shortcomings of public opinion surveys in predicting the 2016 Presidential Election has boosted the search for new methods to measure public sentiment about presidential candidates Using millions of comments taken from a political subforum on the social media website Reddit we were able to construct a pair of bag of words sentiment models that measured the cumulative daily score of all comments containing one of the candidate s names With a short delay to account for the time it takes to conduct polls the time series data for each candidate has an inverse correlation with their polling averages in the 2016 Presidential Election meaning that more discussion correlated with worse performance in polls These results show the potential for using Reddit as a source for real time political prediction that relies less on public polling The correlation also suggests that online discussion around media events and news stories were almost always negative and played a fundamental role in determining shifts in public opinion during the 2016 election cycle The data has several distinct advantages over polling such as a much faster turnaround time near zero operation costs and drawing from a much larger population Similar analysis of Reddit data using different keywords also shows potential for determining how certain scandals or news events such as the Comey letter affected the polls and outcome of the election Authors Ashvin Govil Holistic Action Transform Honors Theses 05 23 2019 HR 19 15 final thesis pdf Robots can be expensive and fragile It can also take them a long time to execute instructions in the physical world These are some reasons why a simulation environment is often used as a proxy for the real world when having a robot learn how to perform a task well However this carries the risk of the robot learning a skill which overfits to the simulator This overfitting leads to the learnt skill not performing well in the real world That is why there is previous work which makes efforts to automatically modify the simulator to minimize differences between the simulator and the real environment Intuitively a simulator models an environment well if for each skill under consideration there is a correlation between the performances of the physical agent and the simulation agent on the given task In this work we introduce Holistic Action Transform HAT which lets us encode this intuition about what it means to be a good simulator into the measures of differences between reality and simulation that we minimize with simulator optimization We then evaluate HAT in a simple Linear Dynamical System domain We establish that minimizing these measures of differences in this domain can increase the correlation between performances of agents in the two environments which enables the simulation agent to learn skills that transfer well to the real world Finally we make empirical comparisons between HAT and previous work We find that HAT is able to match the best possible performance of the Grounded Action Transform GAT on this domain and perform better than GAT for some training datasets Authors Harsh Goyal You2Me Inferring Body Pose in Egocentric Video via First and Second Person Interactions Honors Theses 05 22 2019 HR 19 14 EvonneNThesis pdf The body pose of a person wearing a camera is of great interest for applications in augmented reality healthcare and robotics yet much of the person s body is out of view for a typical wearable camera We propose a learning based approach to estimate the camera wearer s 3D body pose from egocentric video sequences Our key insight is to leverage interactions with another person whose body pose we can directly observe as a signal inherently linked to the body pose of the first person subject We show that since interactions between individuals often induce a well ordered series of back and forth responses it is possible to learn a temporal model of the interlinked poses even though one party is largely out of view We demonstrate our idea on a variety of domains with dyadic interaction and show the substantial impact on egocentric body pose estimation which improves the state of the art Authors Evonne Ng The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Learning Social Behavior from Human Feedback in Ad Hoc Teamwork Honors Theses 05 21 2019 HR 19 13 Thesis pdf One successful approach to quickly training agents to perform at human levels is known as TAMER By accepting human feedback during training agents utilizing the TAMER framework can integrate that feedback to refine a better internal value function Our work explore the application of TAMER to a more complex multi agent domain In this domain the TAMER framework is extended to handle an additional filter to prevent restricted actions We analyze the performance of this STAR framework on both objectives as we vary the agents restrictions We compare two ways of providing feedback to STAR agents based on their speed and effectiveness of learning This comparison illuminates the potential usage of STAR to teach agents value functions while obeying learnt restrictions Authors Avilash Rath The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Optimizing Lattice Linear Predicate Detection for Combinatorial Optimization Problems Honors Theses 05 17 2019 HR 19 12 LLPOpt pdf We present optimization strategies to the lattice linear predicate detection algorithm a general parallel framework for solving the subclass of combinatorial optimization problems whose constraints can be modeled using the lattice linear property This method is based on mapping the search space of this class of problems to a distributive lattice and e ciently nding a solution vector that satis es the problem predicate We implement the lattice linear predicate detection algorithm to run in parallel on a single machine We examine ve well known combinatorial optimization problems housing allocation job scheduling market clearing price shortest path and stable marriage to demonstrate how these optimization strategies apply and perform Finally we compare solving each problem through traditional sequential algorithms versus the optimized lattice linear predicate detection algorithm Authors Calvin Ly The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science GPU Bit Slice Vectors Honors Theses 05 20 2019 HR 19 11 Thesis pdf This paper introduces the concept of bit slice vectors for unsinged integer storage and addition on the GPU By deriving unsigned integer formats from bitslicing principles we can decrease memory consumption and improve overall execution time for variables of arbitrary precision We apply our formats to modern GPU programs and generalize our optimizations for further applicability Our goal is to demonstrate the usefulness of bitslice vectors on the GPU in order to address the dearth of papers on this topic Authors Kevin Pick The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Real Time Filler Word Detection in Conversational Speech Honors Theses 05 18 2019 HR 19 10 Honors Thesis Distribution pdf Filler words such as uh and um are frequently used in everyday conversational speech These fillers are undesirable and often times go unnoticed by the speaker themselves The first step in reducing the amount of filler words said is identifying them as they are spoken In this paper we present an implementation of a real time filler word detection system This system can be used as a public speaking assistant to help people increase awareness of spoken filler words with the intent of eliminating them over time Authors John Herrick The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Black Box Optimization of Parameterized Link Dependent Road Tolling Honors Theses 05 18 2019 HR 19 09 thesis pdf In the micro tolling paradigm a centralized system manager sets different toll values for each link in a given traffic network with the objective of minimizing the total travel time of agents in the system In this thesis we extend previous work on the Enhanced Delta Tolling algorithm for updating link tolls Specifically we study the performance of this algorithm when the parameters are tuned with different black box optimization techniques We describe the relevant parameter tuning problem and its black box formulation including constraints and assumptions Next we conduct several empirical studies on how to solve this problem examining the optimization from different lenses of criteria We show empirically that using CMA ES for parameter tuning can yield up to 23 reduced system travel time compared to the previous best Enhanced Delta Tolling performance and up to 52 reduced system travel time compared to a baseline with no tolls Furthermore we explore using a hybrid technique combining CMA ES and finite difference gradient descent and show that this approach can sometimes achieve comparable performance to CMA ES while reducing worst case performance Finally we show that by reducing the population size for CMA ES we can reduce the number of function evaluations by at least 75 while still achieving system performance that is better than the previous best approach Authors John Fang The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Understanding Compressed Caching through the Compressed Optimal Honors Theses 05 10 2019 HR 19 08 thesis pdf Cache sizes have expanded dramatically in recent years to meet the demands of modern memory intensive applications however further increasing on chip cache sizes has become more difficult due to complex tradeoffs between die space latency and power Hardware cache compression is an attractive alternative to directly increasing the cache size as it allows for higher effective cache capacity and thus better cache hit rates and system performance while keeping the physical size of the cache the same While prior work has demonstrated the potential performance benefits of employing compression in last level caches through experimentation none have answered the question what is the potential in terms of improved hit rate for compressed caches This thesis answers this question by providing a tractable integer linear programming formulation of the compressed optimal hitrate and evaluates the optimal hit rate of several compressed caching architectures In doing so we show that more restrictive practical architectures like Yet Another Compressed Cache YACC can achieve similar theoretical hit rates to more permissive architectures and furthermore that there is a large gap between the compressed optimal and existing compressed replacement policies like CAMP Finally to try and close this gap we propose an extension of the Hawkeye replacement policy for the YACC compressed cache On 22 SPEC2006 memory intensive benchmarks our Hawkeye variant obtains an 18 higher hitrate than CAMP on average 13 higher on compressible benchmarks and a 13 higher hitrate than YACC RRIP on average 10 higher on compressible benchmarks This translates to Compressed Hawkeye having 3 24 higher IPC than CAMP on average and up to 12 higher and 2 30 higher IPC than YACC RRIP on average up to 12 higher Authors Michael S Brenan III The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Implementing Stateless Clients in Ethereum Honors Theses 05 16 2019 HR 19 07 thesis 93d3253 pdf Ethereum is a blockchain based cryptocurrency and platform for decentralized applications A key problem that Ethereum currently faces is scalability Ethereum can only process about 15 transactions per second while other payment processors like Visa can process 24000 transactions per second One reason for these scalability problems is due to disk I O operations Stateless Clients is a proposal to improve the scalability of Ethereum by reducing the amount of I O operations Ethereum nodes need to perform The Stateless Clients proposal does this by using Merkle proofs of state values accessed during transaction execution These Merkle proofs are called witnesses Witnesses are created and sent along with transactions in blocks from miners to other Ethereum nodes Ethereum nodes use witnesses to verify transactions without needing access to the Ethereum state which greatly reduces the amount of I O operations However a major problem with this proposal is that the size of the witnesses is extremely large which makes using Stateless Clients impractical In this paper I show how Stateless Clients works in detail discuss how I implemented Stateless Clients in the Parity Ethereum client and present results that demonstrate that the Stateless Clients proposal is not practical Authors Souvik Banerjee The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science A3P Audio as a Preview for Efficient Activity Recognition in Video Honors Theses 05 15 2019 HR 19 06 Andrew Li Thesis pdf Action recognition has become an increasingly popular task but most modern methods based on deep convolutional neural networks fail to consider the computational cost of the models When working with frames there is a trade off between selecting a dense set of frames which covers the entire video but have a high computational cost and a sparse set of frames which have a low computational cost but may skip over important frames In contrast with audio one can get the best of both worlds one can densely summarize a video with a number of parameters comparable to that of only a few frames We propose Audio as a Preview A3P which treats audio data as a summary of a video clip to intelligently select which frames of a video are processed for visual features when performing activity recognition Our system attempts to both choose frames which are conducive to classification as well as minimize the number of frames actually selected We evaluate our model on two challenging first person video datasets GTEA Gaze and EPIC KITCHENS and experiment with several variants of our model Our method performs better than several baselines we considered including naive implementations of audio based frame selection though certain other baselines outperform it Based on our results we propose further improvements which could be made Authors Andrew Li The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Monophonic Automatic Music Transcription with Convolutional Neural Networks Honors Theses 05 15 2019 HR 19 05 Lee Thesis 2019 pdf This thesis utilizes convolutional neural networks for monophonic automatic music transcription of piano music We present three different systems utilizing CNNs to perform onset pitch and offset detection to get a final output of sheet music Our TCN system is based on Bai et al s TCN architecture and it achieved the best results due to having the best offset detection and we were able to get fairly accurate sheet music from this system Authors Mina Lee The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Extracting Social Sentiment From Radio Playlists Honors Theses 05 14 2019 HR 19 04 JaydeepSinghThesis pdf In this paper we explore ways of extracting social signal from public music data Our study aims to categorize Saudi Arabian radio songs into 8 emotional groups and check for a correlation with major social events We show that by isolating key words from the lyrics of the songs and assigning keywords a score using crowd sourced linguistic data we are able to find numerical signal in the choice of radio songs and can use economic sentiment indices to predict the emotional composition of radio songs Our method of emotional categorization gets 53 accuracy on English songs and is also extended to non English songs By applying permutation tests on the distributions of emotion before and after social events we found a statistically significant change for a variety of emotions following the coronation of King Salman the crowning of Mohammed bin Salman the Saudi Arabian anti corruption drive and the introduction of the Value Added Tax Additionally we found a strong correlation between our sadness score and the Consumer Confidence Index in Saudi Arabia Authors Jaydeep Singh The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Semantic Jitter for Learning Binary Visual Attributes Honors Theses 05 14 2019 HR 19 03 SaketSadani Honors Thesis pdf Solving the classification task can allow us to make meaningful predictions about what properties or attributes an image exhibits It can allow us to determine whether a shoe is fancy or not or if a face is smiling With advances in machine learning our ability to make such predictions has seen significant improvement over the years However most successful methods in solving this problem are supervised meaning that they require labeled data Depending on the domain acquiring such data can be difficult Thus it is worthwhile to be able to construct more training samples from existing data Prior work has been done to this effect often in the form of low level jitter which employs spatial and photometric changes to add variety to the original dataset In this work we train classifiers to learn to predict binary attribute labels by augmenting our training data with new semantically jittered images To do so we use an attribute conditioned generative model to create label preserving changes to existing data We show that in some cases our proposed techniques result in higher classification accuracy than the baselines on the challenging UT Zap50k and CelebA datasets Furthermore preliminary experiments show that in the case where the original dataset contains a class imbalance our technique provides more substantial improvements Authors Saket Sadani The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science Sample effcient Imitation from Observation on a Robotic Arm Honors Theses 05 14 2019 HR 19 02 sample efficient ifo sean geiger pdf Recent applications of generative adversarial networks to the task of imitation learning have achieved significant performance improvements over other methods for imitating complex behaviors However these networks require many demonstration examples and learning iterations to produce a policy that is successful at imitating a demonstrator s behavior Meanwhile in the field of reinforcement learning linear quadratic regulators LQR s have been used to achieve sample efficient learning in techniques that employ neural networks such as guided policy search In this paper we investigate whether using LQR s in a similar way with generative adversarial networks can also increase sample efficiency in imitation learning We propose an algorithm to combine the two techniques and conduct experiments using an imitation task on a robot arm and in simulation to compare the learning rate of generative adversarial learning with our mixed approach We find that this new method results in successful imitation learning with fewer samples than generative adversarial imitation networks alone Authors Sean Geiger The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science RIDM Reinforced Inverse Dynamics Modeling for Learning from a Single Observed Demonstration Honors Theses 05 13 2019 HR 19 01 bsp ug thesis pdf Imitation learning has long been an approach to alleviate the tractability issues that arise in reinforcement learning However most literature makes several assumptions such as access to the expert s actions availability of many expert demonstrations and injection of task specific domain knowledge into the learning process We propose reinforced inverse dynamics modeling RIDM a method of combining reinforcement learning and imitation from observation IfO to perform imitation using a single expert demonstration with no access to the expert s actions and with little task specific domain knowledge Given only a single set of the expert s raw states such as joint angles in a robot control task at each time step we learn an inverse dynamics model to produce the necessary low level actions such as torques to transition from one state to the next such that the reward from the environment is maximized We demonstrate that RIDM outperforms other techniques when we apply the same constraints on other methods on five domains of the MuJoCo simulator and for two different robot soccer tasks for two experts from the RoboCup 3D simulation league on the SimSpark simulator Authors Brahma S Pavse The University of Texas at Austin

search engine that takes an image as query and returns a ranked list of images sharing similar visual properties and class labels We explore two main research questions how traditional image processing techniques compare to a convolutional neural model for image retrieval and how designs can facilitate searching and improve user experiences for image search engines A breakdown of our process includes processing the query image to extract key features searching in a database for relevant images based on these features and displaying a ranked list of results with a user friendly

Edsger Wybe Dijkstra was one of the most influential members of computing science s founding generation Among the domains in which his scientific contributions are fundamental are algorithm design programming languages program design operating systems distributed processing formal specification and verification design of mathematical arguments In addition Dijkstra was intensely interested in teaching and in the relationships between academic computing science and the software industry During his forty plus years as a computing scientist which included positions in both academia and industry Dijkstra s contributions brought him many prizes and awards including computing science s highest honor the ACM Turing Award The Manuscripts Like most of us Dijkstra always believed it a scientist s duty to maintain a lively correspondence with his scientific colleagues To a greater extent than most of us he put that conviction into practice For over four decades he mailed copies of his consecutively numbered technical notes trip reports insightful observations and pungent commentaries known collectively as EWDs to several dozen recipients in academia and industry Thanks to the ubiquity of the photocopier and the wide interest in Dijkstra s writings the informal circulation of many of the EWDs eventually reached into the thousands Although most of Dijkstra s publications began life as EWD manuscripts the great majority of his manuscripts remain unpublished They have been inaccessible to many potential readers and those who have received copies have been unable to cite them in their own work To alleviate both of these problems the department has collected over a thousand of the manuscripts in this permanent web site in the form of PDF bitmap documents to read them you ll need a copy of Acrobat Reader We hope you will find it convenient useful inspiring and enjoyable The original manuscripts along with diaries correspondence photographs and other papers are housed at The Center for American History of The University of Texas at Austin Indexes Each manuscript file is accessible through either of two indexes 0 BibTeX index Each entry includes all the available bibliographic data 1 Ad hoc indexes These contain titles only but are faster if you know what you re looking for EWD numbered documents This index gives an approximate correspondence between manuscripts EWD numbers and the year in which they appeared Technical reports from the Mathematical Centre now CWI Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica PhD thesis 5 3 MB Other documents You can find a table relating EWD numbers to publication years here Many of the privately circulated manuscripts collected here were subsequently published their copyrights are held by their respective publishers Transcripts and translations A growing number of the PDF bitmap documents have been transcribed to make them searchable and accessible to visitors who are visually impaired A few of the manuscripts written in Dutch have been translated into English and one EWD1036 has been translated into Spanish EWD28 has been translated from English into Russian For these transcriptions and translations we are grateful to over sixty contributors Volunteers willing to transcribe manuscripts are always welcome Note doing EWDs justice in translation has turned out to be too difficult so we are no longer soliciting translations Proofreading Each transcription gets a cursory scan as it s prepared for uploading but since a web page can always be updated I don t strive for unattainable perfection before installing it On the web proofreading is a game that can be played by every reader if you spot an error please archiveewdijkstra net Links between EWDs A compilation of cross references has been contributed by Diethard Michaelis As its author notes the collection is incomplete and all readers are invited to add to it Dijkstra often returned to topics about which he had already written when he had something new to say or even just a better way of saying it When Dijkstra himself didn t provide the backward references we indicate the relationship by see also links in the index leaving the judgment of the extent to which the earlier EWD is superseded by the later one to the reader Any reader who notices such a relationship is invited to archiveewdijkstra net Summaries We have begun adding summaries of the EWDs This innovation was suggested by G nter Rote who contributed the first dozen summaries Additional contributions of summaries especially summaries in English of EWDs in Dutch are most welcome Copyrights Copyrights in most EWDs are held by his children one of whom handles requests for permission to publish reproductions The exceptions are documents that were published and whose copyrights are held by their publishers those documents are listed here and each one is provided with a cover page identifying the copyright holder Because the original manuscripts are in possession of the Briscoe Center for American History at The University of Texas the Center s policies are also applicable Video and audio In addition to the manuscripts you may enjoy some recordings of Dijkstra lectures and interviews About Dijkstra and his work An interview with Dijkstra Spanish translation here was conducted in 1985 by Rogier F van Vlissingen who has also written a personal reflection on Dijkstra s sense of what computer science and programming are and what they aren t Another interview was conducted by Philip L Frana in August 2001 A transcript is available in the on line collection of the Charles Babbage Institute To mark the occasion of Dijkstra s retirement in November 1999 from the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in Computer Sciences which he had occupied since 1984 and to celebrate his forty plus years of seminal contributions to computing science the Department of Computer Sciences organized a symposium In Pursuit of Simplicity which took place on his birthday in May 2000 The symposium s program 10 MB contains an outline of Dijkstra s career as well as a collection of quotes culled from his writings from his blackboard and from what others have said about him Banquet speeches by David Gries Fred Schneider Krzysztof Apt W M Turski and H Richards were recorded on a video Dijkstra s death in August 2002 was marked by many obituaries and memorials including the Computer Sciences department s memorial celebration A remembrance of Dijkstra was posted in May 2008 by Maarten van Emden thanks to Tristram Brelstaff for noting it A blog devoted to Dijkstra s works and thoughts has been created and is being maintained by the historian of computing Edgar G Daylight An article by Daylight Dijkstra s Rallying Cry for Generalization the Advent of the Recursive Procedure late 1950s early 1960s appeared in The Computer Journal March 2011 In his blog A Programmer s Place Maarten van Emden has an entry entitled Another scoop by Dijkstra The entry describes Dijkstra s remarkable insight in Notes on Structured Programming EWD 249 that resolves the stand off between the Sieve of Eratosthenes efficient in terms of time but not memory and the method of Trial Division efficient in terms of memory but not time by applying the Assembly line Principle The Edsger W Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing honors Dijkstra s foundational work on concurrency primitives such as the semaphore concurrency problems such as mutual exclusion and deadlock reasoning about concurrent systems and self stabilization which comprises one of the most important supports upon which the field of distributed computing is built The Dijkstra Memorial Lectures A series of annual lectures in memory of Dijkstra commenced at The University of Texas in

office as soon as possible For quicker responses email us at housing austin utexas edu or request to speak with a housing representative by calling 512 471 3136 The housing office is temporarily closed to in person visits until further notice Safety Protocols What is the notification process for COVID 19 positive tests in the residence halls The process begins when 1 a student tests positive at University Health Services UHS or UT Health Austin 2 Austin Public Health notifies the UT Austin Contact Tracing Team about a student with a positive test result who was tested off campus or 3 a student self reports their positive test The UT Austin Contact Tracing Team reaches out to the student s close and primary contacts asks them to quarantine and provides them with testing The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines a close and primary contact as anyone who has spent more than 15 minutes at less than six feet away from the person who has tested positive As an additional measure University Housing and Dining UHD reaches out to students in the wing or floor depending on the size of the building and notifies them about the positive case These people could be secondary or casual contacts who may have had a brief or passing exposure not consistent with a close and primary contact These contacts are advised to self monitor and are encouraged to get tested through the UT Proactive Community Testing program If more than one student on a wing or floor receives a positive test result within five days of each other students will not be sent an additional notification If a student on a wing or floor receives a positive test result after five days since the last notification UHD will send out another notification Students residing in University Apartments will not receive casual contact notifications since individual units have exterior doors and no shared hallways The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention whose guidance the university follows has no recommendation to notify the entire residence hall and communicating a positive case to an entire residence hall when increased risk of transmission is unlikely Our current approach is based on current public health guidance and principles of transmission For example if a resident on the first floor contracted the virus someone on the third floor would have no greater risk than they would in all other areas of their life If my roommate tests positive how do I get my room disinfected University Health Services will contact the roommate of a student who tests positive and ask if they want their room disinfected or the roommate can directly inform their resident assistant or front desk if they want their room disinfected We will coordinate with the resident temporarily moving them to another room if needed while their room is being cleaned The room will be cleaned using an electrostatic sprayer This includes all furniture mattresses floors walls and closet area What steps are being taken for students health and safety Students were asked to sign an amendment to the University Housing and Dining Terms and Conditions prior to moving in agreeing to expectations around health and safety including wearing recommended protective face masks and social distancing University Housing and Dining is implementing policies and practices in alignment with the university s health and

TexasSports com Ticket Office Texas Longhorns Official Shop News Home About This Site About This Site The University of Texas at Austin launched the current version of its website in April 2015 The website redesign project a collaboration between University Communications and Information Technology Services reflects recommendations made by the Mobile Strategy Task Force to improve and update the digital presence of UT Austin The 2015 redesign represents a substantial change in both appearance and approach for the university s main website It accomplishes more by doing less The last thing we want is to create additional obstacles between our users and the information they are looking for which in most cases already exists in more helpful detail on one of the university s many subsites Starting with the needs of our audience and data collected from across the university we carefully vetted content reducing copy to that which our users find most useful and interesting and linking to the rest What resulted is a website that is more streamlined and focused helping provide a simpler path to navigating a university that when you consider the countless number of available resources and opportunities can be quite complex It is designed for access and inclusion This site will be used on an array of devices in a wide range of environments and for a variety of practical purposes serving a diverse community of users with very different needs While our desire for updated modern aesthetics was on its own an important aspect that shaped the direction of our design ensuring that we met the highest standards for usability was continually the top factor driving design decisions From the color palette and menu structure to the way each responsive page element rearranges and adjusts based on the size of your browser this design aims to achieve a harmonious balance between beauty and function for all users It is just the first step The UT Austin website is intended to appeal primarily to potential newcomers to the Forty Acres prospective students faculty staff or donors But its redesign marks a major step forward in the efforts to improve the digital experience for the entirety of the UT Austin community As we develop additional digital solutions focused more fully on the needs of UT Austin s many other online audiences we intend for this site s successes and failures to inform our work and the work of digital professionals throughout the university We welcome your comments and feedback Connect with UT Austin Subscribe to our newsletter Facebook Twitter

the complaint is being made the Dean of the academic unit about which any complaint is being made or the Director of the program or office involved as circumstances warrant Please provide any complaints in writing or by e mail Of course oral complaints to a staff supervisor may be more appropriate when safety issues are involved and quick reaction time would be imperative Complaints regarding university facilities or employees will be acknowledged by the appropriate university supervisor immediately if the complaint is made in person or within 10 business days of receipt if made by mail or email Requests for written information will be handled within 10 business days or as soon as reasonably possible in the case of extensive requests The university administration encourages its employees to handle all requests for information and complaints in a reasonable and timely manner The university s telephone system is equipped with voice mail for leaving messages Employees are encouraged to return phone messages the same or next business day after receipt Generally responses to questions received over the telephone should be made within a few business days of receipt or receipt of a voice mail message by the person whose phone it is For security reasons staff are discouraged from receiving messages left on the voice mailbox of other persons Persons reaching a university office in error will be directed to the appropriate office if known Every reasonable attempt will be made to connect the caller with the appropriate office without being transferred more than once The university cannot be responsible for the timeliness or quality of service for events in its facilities that are sponsored or performed by groups outside the university Complaints regarding quality or timeliness of service on such occasions should be addressed directly to the outside group involved Customer Satisfaction Surveys The University will measure customer service satisfaction through survey forms distributed at its facilities on a rotating basis Ratings of all facilities and activities will be reviewed to ensure that we are providing quality services Again The

archive pageNovember 17 2018What is machine learning Karen HaohideMachine learning algorithms are responsible for the vast majority of the artificial intelligence advancements and applications you hear about For more background check out our first flowchart on What is AI here What is the definition of machine learning Machine learning algorithms use statistics to find patterns in massive amounts of data And data here encompasses a lot of things numbers words images clicks what have you If it can be digitally stored it can be fed into a machine learning algorithm Machine learning is the process that powers many of the services we use today recommendation systems like those on Netflix YouTube and Spotify search engines like Google and Baidu social media feeds like Facebook and Twitter voice assistants like Siri and Alexa The list goes on In all of these instances each platform is collecting as much data about you as possible what genres you like watching what links you are clicking which statuses you are reacting to and using machine learning to make a highly educated guess about what you might want next Or in the case of a voice assistant about which words match best with the funny sounds coming out of your mouth Frankly this process is quite basic find the pattern apply the pattern But it pretty much runs the world That s in big part thanks to an invention in 1986 courtesy of Geoffrey Hinton today known as the father of deep learning What is deep learning Deep learning is machine learning on steroids it uses a technique that gives machines an enhanced ability to find and amplify even the smallest patterns This technique is called a deep neural network deep because it has many many layers of simple computational nodes that work together to munch through data and deliver a final result in the form of the prediction What are neural networks Neural networks were vaguely inspired by the inner workings of the human brain The nodes are sort of like neurons and the network is sort of like the brain itself For the researchers among you who are cringing at this comparison Stop pooh poohing the analogy It s a good analogy But Hinton published his breakthrough paper at a time when neural nets had fallen out of fashion No one really knew how to train them so they weren t producing good results It took nearly 30 years for the technique to make a comeback And boy did it make a comeback What is supervised learning One last thing you need to know machine and deep learning comes in three flavors supervised unsupervised and reinforcement In supervised learning the most prevalent the data is labeled to tell the machine exactly what patterns it should look for Think of it as something like a sniffer dog that will hunt down targets once it knows the scent it s after That s what you re doing when you press play on a Netflix show you re telling the algorithm to find similar shows What is unsupervised learning In unsupervised learning the data has no labels The machine just looks for whatever patterns it can find This is like letting a dog smell tons of different objects and sorting them into groups with similar smells Unsupervised techniques aren t as popular because they have less obvious applications Interestingly they have gained traction in cybersecurity What is reinforcement learning Lastly we have reinforcement learning the latest frontier of machine learning A reinforcement algorithm learns by trial and error to achieve a clear objective It tries out lots of different things and is rewarded or penalized depending on whether its behaviors help or hinder it from reaching its objective This is like giving and withholding treats when teaching a dog a new trick Reinforcement learning is the basis of Google s AlphaGo the program that famously beat the best human players in the complex game of Go That s it That s machine learning Now check out the flowchart above for a final recap Note Okay there are technically ways to perform machine learning on smallish amounts of data but you typically need huge piles of it to achieve good results This originally appeared in our AI newsletter The Algorithm To have it

will be administratively housed in the Gates Dell Complex at The University of Texas at Austin Photo credit Vivian Abagiu University of Texas at Austin The National Science Foundation has selected The University of Texas at Austin to lead the NSF AI Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning bolstering the university s existing strengths in this emerging field Machine learning is the technology that drives AI systems enabling them to acquire knowledge and make predictions in complex environments This technology has the potential to transform everything from transportation to entertainment to health care UT Austin already among the world s top universities for artificial intelligence is poised to develop entirely new classes of algorithms that will lead to more sophisticated and beneficial AI technologies The university will lead a larger team of researchers that includes the University of Washington Wichita State University and Microsoft Research This is another important step in our university s ascension as a world leader in machine learning and tech innovation as a whole and I am grateful to the National Science Foundation for their profound support said UT Austin interim President Jay Hartzell Many of the world s greatest problems and challenges can be solved with the assistance of artificial intelligence and it s only fitting given UT s history of accomplishment in this area along with the booming tech sector in Austin that this new NSF institute be housed right here on the Forty Acres UT Austin is simultaneously establishing a permanent base for campuswide machine learning research called the Machine Learning Laboratory It will house the new AI institute and bring together computer and data scientists mathematicians roboticists engineers and ethicists to meet the institute s research goals while also working collaboratively on other interdisciplinary projects Computer science professor Adam Klivans who led the effort to win the NSF AI institute competition will direct both the new institute and the Machine Learning Lab Alex Dimakis associate professor of electrical and computer engineering will serve as the AI institute s co director Machine learning can be used to predict which of thousands of recently formulated drugs might be most effective as a COVID 19 therapeutic bypassing exhaustive laboratory trial and error Klivans said Modern datasets however are often diffuse or noisy and tend to confound current techniques Our AI institute will dig deep into the foundations of machine learning so that new AI systems will be robust to these challenges Additionally many advanced AI applications are limited by computational constraints For example algorithms designed to help machines recognize categorize and label images can t keep up with the massive amount of video data that people upload to the internet every day and advances in this field could have implications across multiple industries Dimakis notes that algorithms will be designed to train video models efficiently For example Facebook one of the AI institute s industry partners is interested in using these algorithms to make its platform more accessible to people with visual impairments And in a partnership with Dell Medical School AI institute researchers will test these algorithms to expedite turnaround time for medical imaging diagnostics possibly reducing the time it takes for patients to get critical assessments and treatment The NSF is investing more than 100 million in five new AI institutes nationwide including the 20 million project based at UT Austin to advance the foundations of machine learning In addition to Facebook Netflix YouTube Dell Technologies and the city of Austin have signed on to transfer this research into practice The

LinkedIn Search for content on UT News Search Button Science Technology Nov 05 2020 Mission Accomplished UT Austin is committed to working with the U S military to identify and prioritize research that can quickly be adapted to help protect and defend the nation s interest A methodical voice tells the watching crowd I am going to remove the lid Everyone is quiet as a robot using artificial intelligence AI opens a trash can and lifts out a bag Students and researchers hold their breath as it navigates across the floor of a mock house avoiding obstacles to its destination Mission accomplished it says The trash has been taken out and the audience applauds This is a huge achievement for the robot designed by a Texas Robotics team for the 2019 RoboCup competition It may seem like a lot of fanfare for a basic chore but it is a complicated task for a machine The robot demonstrated autonomy and communication skills in a changing environment key interests for artificial intelligence experts right now and the U S military Related research could help future service robots go beyond taking out the trash to assisting and performing dangerous tasks keeping soldiers out of harm s way That is why The University of Texas at Austin is proudly partnering with the Army Futures Command a new four star command that is transforming Army modernization Together they are putting useful research into practice on the battlefield more quickly The partnership is a commitment to identify and further early research and development that has the ability to transition rapidly getting new technology quickly to the hands of those who need it The challenges are huge says Justin Hart assistant director of Texas Robotics and an assistant professor of practice with the Department of Computer Science involved in research with the Army Futures Command Hart is an expert on semantic mapping autonomous human robot interaction and artificial intelligence for service robots Multi tasking autonomous AI robots are the holy grail of his field We are doing fundamental research that has the ability to be applied to solve problems We want to ensure there is a pipeline that makes that research available in a usable format The goal is for the robots to always be on and dealing with whatever comes their way That is a grand challenge for robotics Peter Stone The computing and engineering challenges have vast game changing potential for how robots could be deployed in several areas Texas Robotics a robust consortium of interdisciplinary researchers led by the College of Natural Sciences and Cockrell School of Engineering is working to advance the field Texas Robotics collaborative projects explore robotics numerous application spaces including social surgical rehabilitation vehicles drilling manufacturing space nuclear and defense Peter Stone director of Texas Robotics principal investigator for UT Austin s robotics research with the Army Futures Command and prominent AI expert on machine learning and dynamic environments says the university is focusing on two major growth areas The first is long term autonomy the ability for robots to operate self sufficiently for hours or days rather than seconds or minutes The second is human robot interaction that includes autonomous robots that are interacting with people in an unstructured environment This requires the robot to have the ability to respond to and communicate with humans whether in a health care setting on the street or during a mission The goal is for the robots to always be on and dealing with whatever comes their way says Stone That is a grand challenge for robotics Centralizing these efforts makes UT Austin an attractive full service robotics group for industry and government partners Stone says Over the past five or six years we have banded together and formed an interdisciplinary group that has an educational component and that has an industry affiliates program We can explore a lot of synergies across a lot of different perspectives Historically getting new technologies to the soldiers has been a slow process The Army Futures Command s mission is to modernize and speed up that process and Forge the Future In 2018 the Army selected Austin Texas as the headquarters for the command after considering cities across the country The city stood out as an ideal location because of its combination of high tech and science related industries the state government and the academic reach of UT Austin UT s location in the technological hub that is Austin our status of having a top five ranked program in AI and our leadership on a brand new artificial intelligence institute funded by the National Science Foundation help show that our friends in the military selected its robotics research partner wisely in picking UT says Paul Goldbart dean of the College of Natural Sciences Innovation has been happening in the government and in leading research universities for decades says Sharon L Wood dean of the Cockrell School of Engineering But now that we re working together to address specific challenges we can expand our resources and accelerate the speed at which we roll out new technologies This is a win win for both UT Austin and the U S Army Today UT Austin remains fully committed to discovery and advancing the research that could help the world A keystone project in the Army Futures Command partnership is the newly renovated Anna Hiss Gymnasium the centralized home for Texas Robotics The newly finished robotics laboratory in the renovated Anna Hiss Gymnasium The new space is both a research lab and public showcase for all the robotics on campus The university committed to building the space last year The lab benefits the larger robotics program and the military partnership as a hub for cross disciplinary collaborative research The ribbon cutting ceremony for the lab was held Oct 2 2020 with special guest speakers Gov Greg Abbott Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy and UT Austin President Jay Hartzell Texas is ground zero for the next generation of cybersecurity artificial intelligence robotics and all these different strategies that will not only be advancing the United States Army but will be advancing the next level of technology across the entire globe with Austin being the centerpiece of it said Gov Abbott Peter Stone left Gov Greg Abbott center and Sec of the Army Ryan McCarthy right at the opening event Texas is ground zero for the next generation of cybersecurity artificial intelligence and robotics Gov Greg Abbott Our commitment to the Army knows no bounds said President Hartzell at the ribbon cutting We are a world class partner and destination for the military veterans and their families The university s dedication starts right from the leadership at the top all the way down to the research assistants carrying out the projects says Seth Wilk director of the UT Austin Liaison Office to the Army Futures Command Partnering with the military helps foster collaboration with government and industry and it supports impactful academic research Stone notes having the military involvement is incredibly useful for research inspiration and creates a path to impact A few Army employees are working on campus and embedded in the partner projects from the beginning to help make it more efficient and effective In addition to autonomous robotics the Army s priorities include improving navigation next generation vehicles such as self driving cars and vertical lift aircraft material development and synthetic training environments While other institutions are feeling pressure to pull back in these uncertain times UT Austin remains committed We understand that just as critical technologies have allowed for productivity connection and engagement amid a pandemic we must ensure future technologies are there when we need them too says Goldbart This requires providing researchers with opportunities to solve today s intellectual puzzles and bring about profound and positive breakthroughs to help society address and overcome future challenges Copy link Email Share

3D Simulation competition was the introduction of a humanoid robot replacing the spherical agents used until 2006 Despite not having participated in previous years competitions our team chose to enter the 2007 competitions mainly because we were motivated by the significant challenge of programming a humanoid robot at a low level of control Team Description Paper Our team description paper PS PDF describes the approaches we adopted in designing our agent While we made progress in developing skills like walking and turning we were unable to complete programming others like kicking in time for the competitions As a result our team did not secure a placement Binary Here is a binary of our agent The program has been tested on Ubuntu 5 10 it requires the following libraries for successful

written acknowledgment from the qualified organization indicating the amount of the cash and a description of any property contributed The acknowledgment must say whether the organization provided any goods or services in exchange for the gift and if so must provide a description and a good faith estimate of the value of those goods or services One document from the qualified organization may satisfy both the written communication requirement for monetary gifts and the contemporaneous written acknowledgment requirement for all contributions of 250 or more You must fill out Form 8283

Movement Patterns in Cuzco Peru Submitted by Muhammad Muhdhar on Wed 10 28 2020 5 00pm We live in an increasingly digital era Research shows that the average American checks their phone about 58 times daily and spends an average of 4 5 hours a day on their phone Without a doubt the amount of time the modern day person spends on their phones has changed many aspects of how our society functions For example in the past decade we have seen a dramatic shift in forms of advertising Companies are able to take note of people s patterns online and create personalized ads through the use of artificial intelligence AI Similar to the advertising sphere the internet age has brought great transformation to how researchers study human patterns and how humans interact with the environment Our heavy usage of technology and social media has given researchers more access to our data while advancements in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning enables researchers to categorize and identify patterns in this data more efficiently than ever before It is precisely these two aspects of modern life that shaped the research of The University of Texas at Austin computer scientists Professor Kristen Grauman and Wei Lin Hsiao and anthropologists Professor R Alan Covey and Nicole D Payntar In their research article entitled Learning Patterns of Tourist Movement and Photography from Geotagged Photos at Archaeological Heritage Sites in Cuzco Peru these UT Austin researchers set out to understand how the increase of tourism and social media intersects with heritage regulations to aid in the creation of travel patterns across Cuzco s heritage landscape Additionally they embarked to study and document how social media has affected tourists aesthetic preferences and expectations Tourism in Cuzco Peru the former capital of the Incan empire began in the early 1900s following an expedition by Hiram Bingham By the 1920s government officials realized the economic potential of tourism in Cuzco and began funding the restoration of regional archaeological sites for tourism Since then tourism in Cuzco has taken off Today annual visits in the region top 3 million with heritage tourism tourism that involves traveling to places of cultural significance being a major draw By the late 70s tourist initiatives were being created to promote and popularize tourism in Cuzco s prominent archaeological sites including the creation of the original Boleto Turistico BTC tourist package in 1978 and the promotion of the Inca trail to Machu Picchu Over time these initiatives included packaged day trip itineraries to some Cuzco s more remote archaeological sites In their research Nicole D Payntar Wei Lin Hsiao R Alan Covey and Kristen Grauman collected 57 804 images from community internet photos shared on social media sites captured across 12 archaeological sites in the Cuzco region Through the use of geo tagging technology they were able to detect patterns of tourist movement at these sites and analyze how they ve changed over time AI technology also enabled them to categorize tourist images based on common themes such as mountains stonework alpaca terracing etc From this dataset spanning 2004 2019 these UT Austin researchers were able to bring to light some insightful patterns of tourists in Cuzco Peru They uncovered which sites were the most popular sites in the area the least visited and which sites people spent the most time at The data and geo tagging technology also allowed them to be able to track tourist patterns and determine how tourists moved across these archaeological sites Additionally the researchers were able to determine which type of aesthetic tourists were capturing in their pictures at each site These results led them to conclude that policies in the region have definitely affected how tourists interact with the sites The introduction of the day passes influenced how tourists travel across the region and conservation initiatives and regulations at larger tourist sites led to an increase in photo homogeneity while smaller sites with less regulation had much more diverse pictures The data also showed that the most popular pictures of the Cuzco region shared similar aesthetic qualities with the historic photographs published by Hiram Bingham in the early 20th Century This shows that heritage aesthetics remain pretty similar over time due to the visual reproduction of what is meant to be seen based on perceived experiences and audience consumption A study like this would not be possible if it were not for the rise of social media technologies and innovations in AI specifically applied computer vision and machine learning algorithms Due to our increasing online presence researchers are gaining access to more information about patterns in our lives than ever before AI plays an equally important role as it allows researchers to categorize and identify patterns in this immense amount of data The project would have been impossible to complete without machine learning Nicole D Payntar lead author on this project writes data extracted from photos using machine learning algorithms can

Evolution s Clock Audio Submitted by Anonymous on Wed 10 14 2020 9 00am Photo credit Stephanie Dloniak By Marc G Airhard College of Natural Sciences Evolutionary biologists never have enough time Some of the most mysterious behaviors in the animal kingdom like parenting evolved over thousands of years if not longer Human lifespans are just too short to sit and observe such complex behaviors evolve But computer scientists are beginning to offer clues by using artificial intelligence to simulate the life and death of thousands of generations of animals in a matter of hours or days It s called computational evolution Point of Discovery Artificial Intelligence Revs Up Evolution s Clock One behavior that s long baffled biologists is called mobbing in which a gang of hyenas team up to steal prey from much more powerful lions When UT Austin computer scientists Risto Miikkulainen and Padmini Rajagopalan simulated hyenas and lions on a virtual African savannah they found something surprising Watch a video of real life hyenas mobbing courtesy of Michigan State U Read more Evolution of Complex Coordinated Behavior July 2020 Music for today s show was produced by Podington Bear https www podingtonbear com Pogmothoin a k a Tom Griffin https freesound org people pogmothoin TRANSCRIPT Marc Airhart This is Point of Discovery Today I ve got a special treat I m handing over the reins of the podcast to our science writing intern Cason Hunwick He explores what artificial intelligence might teach us about how hyenas in Africa evolved a surprising hunting tactic Along the way you ll learn about an area of computer science called computational evolution where machines evolve solutions in response to complex problems and a lot more quickly than we living things can do Cason spoke with computer scientists Padmini Rajagopalan and Risto Miikkulainen from The University of Texas at Austin Cason Hunwick Imagine you re in a grassy African savannah the sun s hanging low just about to set but then you hear a lion You look over and see a lion standing over a zebra carcass There s blood and torn striped flesh in its mouth It s clear that the hunt is over and this is dinner But wait a spotted hyena has just approached the lion hoping to do what you just thought was impossible and steal some of the lion s kill It lunges for the zebra carcass But the lion makes a precise powerful strike and sends the hyena screeching and running Of course for a solo hyena to try this is pretty foolhardy and in attempting to steal prey from the lion it could easily become it CH But in groups spotted hyenas have found a way to steal the kill and walk away without a scratch scot free full stomachs They group up and execute a coordinated attack on the lions in a cooperative behavior known as mobbing Back on the savannah let s listen in as a collaborator of two UT computer scientists Michigan State University professor of integrative biology Kay Holekamp looks on at the behavior She is joined by a member of her lab Erin who provides the play by play in this recording of a successful mobbing event in Kenya Erin counts the approaching hyenas Erin one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen Fourteen hyenas CH Two more join and it becomes a frenzy Erin There s a mob kind of circled the lions they ve all clustered up over there Cason And finally they all rush together Erin They ve driven off two of the lions Oh They got the carcass Nice guys CH Mobbing has been the subject of study for decades because it s something of a mystery Hyenas behave instinctually and yet they find strength in numbers Enough hyenas together can overpower the stronger predators But how does this behavior evolve University of Texas at Austin computer science researchers Padmini Rajagopalan and Risto Miikkulainen studied this question Padmini Rajagopalan We can t study evolution in action in the real world the only way we can really do it is in simulation CH That s Rajagopalan She says evolution is just too slow to observe Plus you can t look back in time Instead you have to simulate how hyenas behaviors may have developed over the generations To accomplish this task Rajagopalan started out with 100 randomly generated learning algorithms they re sort of like stands in for those early hyenas brains And out of this first generation of 100 blank slate artificial hyenas Rajagopalan randomly selects ten of them assigning the task to mob the lion Now at least four of them will need to rush the lion simultaneously and if they run in too early they die If they come in after the lion is mobbed they get less food PR This way I test many different teams of 10 hyenas Once I ve done that I look at the population of hyenas and see which were closest to what I wanted them to do CH Many other teams of computerized hyenas from each generation are tested and run through these trials The hyenas that survive get to reproduce PR So what I mean by that is I mix up their little codes and get new hyenas that hopefully have some of the best characteristics CH The ones with higher fitness levels have more offspring This mimics how the behavior evolved in real life Hyenas that behave in ways that are beneficial then survive to mate and pass on their traits while those that behave in ways that hurt their chances of survival and mating are less likely to pass on their traits Repeating this selection testing and reproduction for 1 000 generations happens a lot faster on a computer than in real hyena lifetimes PR In the initial generations we saw other behaviors emerging There was this risk taking behavior where the hyena just went straight to the lion attacked the lion all by itself and died And there were these risk averse hyenas which stayed far away from the lion waiting for it to be driven away So they avoided death but they also didn t get much reward Slowly over the next few generations we saw that mobbing emerged as a kind of combination of these behaviors Both the risk averse and the risk taking CH So in other words mobbing arose out of two kinds of impulses the hyenas developed I don t want to die and I want the reward But then Rajagopalan saw something unexpected Those two extreme behaviors on each end of the spectrum rushing in and dying or waiting around the periphery those did not go away PR Those behaviors I mentioned that emerged early like the simple behaviors of attacking the lion by themselves or waiting around far away and never really participating in the mobbing event these behaviors still tended to stick around even though I evolved the hyenas for a very prolonged period So the mobbing behavior itself did emerge within the first ten generations but I kept the evolution going for 1 000 generations and still these other behaviors did not go away CH Why did they stick around Computer scientist Risto Miikkulainen who was Rajagopalan s advisor for the work asked the same question And he offered an explanation Risto Miikkulainen But why would they stay around You would think that hey now they have a successful mobbing that just takes over the whole population everybody does the same thing But you don t see that in biology I mean in all kinds of societies you see a persistent minority and we saw it here as well And that was a surprise but after the fact we can explain it Let s say that now there s a new species or new group of lions that are much much stronger for some reason So now it s really good to have hyenas that are less bold and the species survives and they develop a better strategy CH And similarly if lions became weaker being that fearless go it alone hyena might start to pay off with big rewards CH Now Miikkulainen explains that while these simulations are useful they won t entirely replace field work in the real world RM Computational simulations can always give you suggestions or insights or proposals on what to look at But the actual verification still has to be done in the discipline itself CH So thankfully biologists and computational scientists aren t in opposition Scientists can use technology in some constructive back and forth Biologists find something interesting in the field maybe in cells or primate behavior and computer scientists study it in theoretical space returning to the biologists a suggestion for what to look for in the field in real life For example in mobbing the UT computer scientists may ask field researchers if they observe those two hyena behaviors that stuck around in the simulations maybe if they see a hyena lurking far away and joining only after the mobbing has ended or if they see that brave hyena rushing in alone and risking its life In this way both groups need each other And there are plenty of fields this new kind of artificial intelligence computational evolution it s called could help Any field that involves complex problem solving can benefit from systems that evolve solutions to problems But Miikkulainen again makes it clear that the technology isn t meant to replace humans RM We are talking about machine creativity and machines coming up with surprises and solutions that humans won t think about But it s still a tool for humans It s an extension of their thinking CH This is Cason Hunwick reporting for Point of Discovery MA Thank you Cason

on COVID 19 Get help with Instructional Continuity and working from home You are hereHome New Faculty Profile Simon Peter Submitted by Julianne Hodges on Tue 05 30 2017 8 00am As an undergrad at the Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg in Germany UTCS professor Simon Peter had two main hobbies music and computer operating systems While majoring in computer science he also completed a minor in music For a while he was even interested in working on music synthesizers his dream project is an operating system for synthesizers I eventually decided to go the operating systems route for my Ph D but it s a possibility I could have been a synthesizer engineer he said Music can be very rigorous and mathematical in the way that it s expressed From the practical side there is a lot of engineering to music such as sound engineering Peter works on the efficiency and reliability of data centers at all levels of problems from routing around failures in data centers to the energy efficiency of servers His current research which he had just started a couple of years before coming to UT last fall focuses on helping servers improve efficiency so that they can deal with large amounts of data going in and out of servers This is called called IO or input output efficiency Peter explained that computers were originally designed with the assumption that processing capacity is fast enough but IO paths in and out of the servers didn t need to be as fast However as the use of data centers becomes increasingly popular more and more people are accessing and entering more and more data in a server leading to more requests to these servers The data centers themselves have become this driver of the economy so everybody in society in one way or another is using data centers these days Peter said So the amount of data that goes in and out of the individual data centers is becoming larger and larger and servers are becoming overwhelmed and that s because they have not really been built with that in mind For example his research involves working to redesign the operating system for faster IO devices Hardware architects have been building better and better networking and storage technologies that become faster but there are still a few pieces missing he said One piece is the design of the operating system which has become a bottleneck to all of this because it was totally designed with the assumption that IO devices are slow Data centers are becoming more important because everyday applications such as email and webs searches use data centers according to Peter We have transformed into a completely digital society and everybody s making use of digital services he said The main driver to all of this is that society has basically become dependent on the data center Peter attributes his interest in the practical operating systems side of computer science to playing with the Linux operating system That was a big thing for me when it came out because it was freely available anybody could play with it and try to make it better he said I had done this as a hobby for some time and once I had discovered that you can do this as a Ph D and do research in this I was hooked This spring Peter introduced a project based operating systems class to undergrad CS students In the class students are given the beginning of an operating system and have to build the rest themselves I will give them a little bit of guidance especially in the beginning there will be some milestones that they have to complete he said Towards the end it will become more and more freeform and they can go off and design it in the way that they like To finish the class they had to present and defend their operating system to Peter and the teaching assistants in order to practice how computer scientists and engineers must defend their work while researching or working in the industry I strongly believe that in a practical kind of science like systems you learn best by doing things rather than reading a book about it he said It s really important that students actually work on and implement a small operating system in this class to learn more about how low level systems engineering is done As a researcher Peter likes interacting and collaborating with colleagues both in academia and in the industry He said in operating systems research collaboration is helpful because systems problems can become very complex and require a lot of implementation work You work in teams on most of these problems rather than just being by yourself and studying it by yourself he said Basically in order to get things of this scale done you can t do it all on your own you have to be able to work with other people News categories FacultyTags Simon Peternew faculty Add new

and links may no longer work Submitted by Julianne Hodges on Mon 10 17 2016 4 30pm UT Computer Science Assistant Professor Faculty Fellowship 6 In Computer Sciences Chris Rossbach This is part of a series featuring personal profiles of the new faculty at UT Computer Science Chris Rossbach didn t take a common path to computer science research He tried out physics philosophy math and religious studies before graduating from Stanford University with a computer science degree Rossbach didn t see a job for himself in computers though so he became a professional musician and yoga teacher However after 13 years of working more and more with computers in his spare time he finally decided to pursue computer science as a career Many people come to realize who they are as a professional much quicker but at least I have a high confidence result he said Rossbach joined UTCS this fall as an assistant professor He currently studies operating systems and how to reorganize systems to work better He solves problems with these systems by looking at how all of the parts fit together This is one way of really saying I m interested in operating systems because that s what a computer operating system does he said It s the layer that makes all the things you can see work together In the past he has worked on GPUs or graphics processing units the components that help draw detailed frames of video in video games He tried to work on repurposing GPUs for image processing and computer vision but found that the operating system was hard to work with so he spent years restructuring the operating system That was a lot of work but a lot of fun he said I like to build big systems that potentially take many years but that solve really large scale problems and interact with lots of layers of technology He started out by playing with new technology in order to see what it can do and how it can improve One of these past projects was finding a more intuitive input method for 3D cameras As I got deeper and deeper into that problem it turned out to be much less about the snazzy new camera that attracted me and much more about the structure of all the components he said It turned out to reveal what I think are some fundamental flaws in the way modern operating systems are currently designed Computer scientists need to change the way they think about OS structures in order to adapt to new technology according to Rossbach Adapting basic CPU systems with traditional storage and network systems doesn t work that well anymore he said because of more specialized hardware and software in devices like cell phones and the trend towards moving information to distributed cloud systems I think we re now at a point where it s just not going to fly anymore he said We keep just hacking at the problem and making piecemeal changes These two forces of lower level specialization and higher level distribution are in tension and they re pulling apart at the seams the fabric that has been around for a long time Rossbach said these current challenges make today an interesting time in systems research I feel like it s a good time to be working in this area he said It s easy to make a splash because there s so much openness in the problem space If students are interested in operating systems come talk to me the door s always open News categories FacultyTags Chris

on COVID 19 Get help with Instructional Continuity and working from home You are hereHome New Faculty Profile Vijay Chidambaram Submitted by Eric Lee on Wed 04 19 2017 1 30pm Vijay Chidambaram did not start off wanting to go into research While earning his Bachelor s from the College of Engineering Guindy in India in 2009 Chidambaram focused on his goal of nabbing a job at a big company After an internship during his Master s studies Chidambaram realized that working as a software engineer did not appeal to him as much as he expected He felt there was a better way for him to impact the world As a Master s student at the University of Wisconsin Madison Chidambaram discovered a passion for teaching and research He found that he enjoyed the high level of control he had with his work while having flexibility over the topics his research covered Chidambaram focused his research on operating systems at the University of Wisconsin Madison and did several research based internships with Microsoft before graduating with a Ph D in 2015 Thereafter Chidambaram brought his expertise to VMware building an innovative tool that impacts future applications for non volatile memory technologies by providing an easy to use framework for their development In Fall of 2016 after his research at VMware Chidambaram seized the opportunity to become an assistant professor at UT Computer Science UT has a great computer science department Chidambaram says and the surrounding area is a great place to have an interesting life outside of CS In the short time that he has been at UT Chidambaram has done many notable things for the department Working closely with the faculty and staff Chidambaram has helped design an upper division elective in the area of computer systems as well as give feedback on the designs on two to three other classes that will be implemented in fall of 2017 He has helped design new classes for students who want to continue to pursue studies related to our classes for 429 and 439 Director Bruce Porter says Additionally Chidambaram helped establish a research lab where his research students can focus on topics related to operating systems such as file systems distributed systems and virtualization There s a lot I hope to do in my time here Chidambaram says I hope to revamp the computer science syllabus and help students get hands on experience in topics I will teach such as virtualization or how storage works Additionally since technology is moving so fast I want to build a strong research group not just purely academic where research will affect the industry As a researcher Chidambaram s work has not gone unnoticed Just last year Chidambaram received the widely acclaimed SIGOPS Dennis M Ritchie Dissertation Award for his doctoral dissertation in Orderless and Eventually Durable File Systems In that dissertation Chidambaram presented a method to decouple the ordering of streams of data from durability So even when an operating system loses its power data does not disappear In doing so this discovery was able to improve the performance of machines by over tenfold Not long after that Chidambaram was also awarded a Best Paper Award by FAST organizers and USENIX for his research in collaboration with researchers at the University of Wisconsin Madison Application Crash Consistency and Performance with CCFS an overview can be found in The Morning Paper s blog In his research paper Chidambaram and his team were able to recognize the abstraction of a stream and guarantee with streams of data that the ordering of that data would be set Chidambaram stresses the importance of why operating systems are so awe inspiring An operating system is what makes computers run If you are able to work with an operating system you can get computers to do pretty much whatever you want Chidambaram says If you are able to work with operating systems you essentially become a wizard in CS News categories FacultyTags Faculty ProfileVijay

Science Professors Teams Up with Intel Featured Tuesday 10 November 2020 Esther R Robards Forbes Computer Science Industry analysts say that more data has been collected in the past two years than in all of human history combined Data about what we buy what we watch where we go and who our friends are is constantly being collected and stored Analyzing all that data and gaining insights from it is the hard part A visual representation of a graph containing epidemiological data Keshav Pingali Enter University of Texas at Austin computer science professor Keshav Pingali and assistant professor Chris Rossbach founders of Katana Graph a startup specializing in graph computing The startup launched in the spring and already has raised 4 4 million Intel recently announced a new partnership with the company to support those hoping to translate large unstructured data sets into efficient solutions to problems Katana Graph s graph computing engine will be offered on several of Intel s platforms You may not have heard of graph computing but companies that use graph computing are likely using it now to learn about you Graphs are a way of drawing insights from unstructured data Structured data is what is found in a carefully constructed database where relationships between data are clear Unstructured data do not have clear relationships and that s where graphs come in Chris Rossbach Imagine an airline route map with lines connecting hub cities with smaller cities There may not be a direct flight from Cincinnati to San Francisco but it s still possible to get there Just as finding the connecting flights allows for arrival at a destination discovering connections between different data points using graphs helps businesses and organizations understand who they serve For example they help Netflix suggest what we should watch next and help Amazon tell us what to buy next Graphs are a way of thinking about data said Pingali CEO of Katana Graph They simplify the job of designing algorithms to process the data and extract insights In the summer of 2019 Pingali the W A Tex Moncrief Jr Chair in Distributed and Grid Computing was visiting his sister in the San Francisco Bay Area following the sale of her startup company After chatting with venture capitalists Pingali pitched the idea for a graph computing company to Rossbach who holds the Computer Sciences Endowed Faculty Fellowship No 6 and has expertise in cloud computing They formed Katana Graph and the startup received its seed funding on March 15 2020 just in time for the global pandemic to hit It hasn t slowed them down much Already Katana Graph s engines are being used in pharmaceutical research to help narrow down which molecular compounds should be tested in the lab epidemiological tracking of COVID 19 computer network security and detection of financial fraud The pandemic makes collaboration a little harder said Rossbach There are definitely times when it would be great to have a whiteboard But by and large we ve made a lot of progress and continue to have a lot of fun and largely be unaffected so I think we re very lucky in that regard Pingali and Rossbach credit some of the success of their company s launch to the support they received from UT Austin The college has been incredibly supportive of this from our chair to the dean Pingali said Everywhere wants to be the next Silicon Valley but putting that sort of desire into action into something that actually makes things happen that s a totally different thing And not many places can do it Katana Graph also received support from the Texas Innovation Center the hub at The University of Texas at Austin for bringing engineering and science discoveries and technologies to the market The Texas Innovation Center is a collaboration between the Cockrell School of Engineering and the College of Natural Sciences which provides resources to help connect companies like Katana Graph with potential customers investors mentors and other needed resources to support translation of university research Through the center IP support is provided by the Office of Technology Commercialization This recent partnership with Intel and an expected new round of funding will fuel an accelerated growth for Katana Graph and adoption of its graph engine said Dr Van Truskett executive director of the Texas Innovation Center Katana Graph is recruiting and employing UT students to work at their company Their success is an example of impact that university research and their resulting startups can have on the economy Tags Computer Science
